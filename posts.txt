What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. You can find book-related posts here. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email at bmw9t@virginia.edu.

Every institution has embedded pedagogies—tacit structures, policies, and norms that govern the possibilities for teaching and learning. The curriculum is only one place in which teaching happens in higher education: every interaction is also a form of teaching, whether it pertains to a syllabus, a budget, or the use of campus space. In other words, the classroom is inseparable from the infrastructure that supports its work. The teacher struggling to find resources for her students, for example, cannot help but have her work affected by the threat of budget cuts. As sociologist Jessica Calarco and others have argued, students are often subject to a hidden curriculum of expectations and practices that reinforce social inequalities. I build on this work by offering a theory of the embedded pedagogies of institutions, those interrelated sets of strictures that pressure instructors to adopt particular pedagogies regardless of their own personal inclination. The book argues that, while these embedded pedagogies could feasibly support effective teaching, they most often inhibit justice-oriented approaches to education. 
Educators are under threat, struggling with institutional instability, scarcity, and political attacks on their work. This book offers guidance for instructors struggling with how to teach effectively in such uncertain and hostile environments, whether that teaching takes place in the classroom or elsewhere. With digital humanities pedagogy at US-based institutions of higher education as a frame and focus, I argue for an approach to teaching and learning that seeks to build more just and equitable institutions while also offering strategies to endure the negative ways these structures influence our work. This book offers a theory and practice of DH pedagogy by speaking from the position of a practitioner tasked with both teaching and administrating in the context of a public university in crisis. Teaching administrators, as I call people in roles like mine, are uniquely positioned to lay bare the pedagogical implications of infrastructural decisions at the same time that they implement a classroom practice that intervenes in their local institution. However, since many of these positions are institutionally unique, term-limited, or one-off, this unique vantage point has not often been formally explored. By focusing specifically on this intersection of teaching and administration, this book offers as much in the way of day-to-day approaches to the DH classroom as it does a far-reaching vision for how our pedagogies can help to bring about a university that is more stable, more sustainable, and more just.
The institutional structures that impact teaching are especially salient for those instructors who work outside departmental silos. For staff who work across departments, the warp and weft of the institutional pedagogy is particularly noticeable because we so regularly come into contact with patrons from across the university. DH pedagogy serves as a useful object of study in this regard, as so much DH teaching takes place in the cracks of the university. As a librarian, I have taught credit-bearing courses as well as one-off workshops, consulted on a graduate certificate in digital humanities as well as mentored students individually. Teaching in these spaces, I argue, reveals the pedagogies operationalized by our institutions for and against our work as teachers. Furthermore, because of its intensely collaborative and cross-disciplinary work, digital humanities teaching frequently forces encounters—and friction—with the university in ways that more narrowly discipline-specific instruction might not. Any instructor is subject to policy. But the librarian providing instruction in digital technology is especially aware of its impact and the ways in which it can be hostile to learning. 
In meeting the limited knowability of the university, we meet the first of the five characteristics that will give this book its structure:

Knowable
Neutral
Intellectual
Prestigious
Forward-looking

These characteristics form the basis of the stories that institutions of higher education typically tell about themselves and who they want to be. They form the basis of the neoliberal university and its mode of describing itself. In each case, these values exert power over the kinds of teaching and learning possible in their spaces, often in ways that instructors would not willingly ascribe to. The body of the book centers on the narratives that universities use to frame themselves as bastions of neutrality, intellectualism, and prestige. In each chapter, I critique the ways in which these values impose themselves as pedagogical forces on DH teachers and offer a pair of action-oriented responses, first as an administrator thinking pedagogically and then as a teacher thinking administratively. The result is one part theory, one part lesson plan. One part discussion, one part assignment template. As educators faced with frustrating circumstances, it can be easy to feel disempowered, as though the institution is too large to change, and to turn inwards, narrowly focusing on the day’s lesson plan in order to carry on. I argue, instead, for a renewed view of higher education institutions in familiar terms for teachers. By demystifying and breaking them down as pedagogical systems, teachers can find opportunities for change and create the conditions for our learning communities to thrive.
The book concludes by meditating on the contested futures at the center of university life. Universities often claim to look towards the future while enshrining hyper-conservative institutional values that favor the past and refuse change. As such, I conclude by questioning the futures towards which universities are working. Who do these futures belong to? Our communities? Or a substratum of donors, politicians, and pundits? We cannot afford to treat the classroom as closed off, separate from the broader administrative context that shapes its spaces. By seeing teaching as an extension of policy—and policy, in turn, as a set of pedagogical interventions—educators can co-create a more hopeful future with their communities. Taken together, the book offers a roadmap for DH educators aiming to push their teaching and their institutions towards more just futures for teachers and learners. By rendering visible the pedagogical structures at the core of the university, I hope to empower educators to develop the tools to change them, in and out of the classroom.
For a first foray into the ways in which the teaching administrator may intervene in their own institution, we can meet the university’s limited knowability with a pedagogy of transparency. The first experiences many members of the university community have of their institutions are heavily manufactured. Whether through mailers to prospective students, new faculty orientations, or ongoing marketing and communication campaigns, universities have a vested interest in the careful articulation of themselves as particular kinds of institutions with specific values, processes, and audiences. Despite these broad campaigns to appear known in the public eye, I argue that this knowability is limited by design: universities deliberately obscure their workings from their community members, a fact that can hide the ways in which institutional policies and choices structure the possibilities for learning available to teachers and students. From an administrative standpoint, I first examine budgets as pedagogical technologies1 that can offer students a vehicle by which they can better understand the infrastructure of their university. Second, from a classroom perspective, I examine digital humanities student projects that challenge the narratives universities share with the public and that attempt to make known their difficult histories. By questioning the received knowability of our institutions in our teaching we can illuminate their effects on our work. By recognizing administrative decisions as pedagogical ones we can recast them on grounds in which teachers might intervene.



This section has already been published as “The Pedagogy of Digital Humanities Budgets” in Issue 25 of The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. But I might post a very short blog post that contextualizes that piece and gives thoughts on how it might need to change as part of the book project. ↩

We’ve got a new thing cooking in the lab - a bite-sized project from Rachel Retica, Seanna Viechweg, and myself. Here’s the description we’ve shared around for what we are calling the “Snack-Sized Digital Pedagogy” series.

It’s important to maintain a balanced teaching diet! This free and open-to-the-public zoom series on digital pedagogy features paired lightning talks introducing teaching topics, interesting approaches to the classroom, pedagogical concepts, and more. All in a bite-sized form that should still give you plenty to chew on. In the spirit of the #DHMakes Methodz talks, each session will be built around paired 5 minute presentations followed by facilitated discussion for the remainder of the time.
Interested in showing off a pedagogical bite? Please fill out this form to indicate your interest in participating in the future! The presentations can cover a wide variety of topics: a tool that is new to you, a teaching tip, pedagogical concept, assignment, your syllabus for a DH course, etc. We’re interested in showcasing anything you have found that moves you or your students in the classroom, that has worked well or failed utterly. And we are very interested in perspectives from folks in all different kinds of positions and institutional contexts—higher ed, K-12, administrators, cultural heritage workers, and more. After the session, each speaker will submit a short one-page (max) version of their five-minute presentation to Knowledge Commons. We’ll collect references to all the contributions into a crowdsourced, citable web publication of bite-sized DH pedagogical goodness.

We already had one session with two bite-sized talks from Megan Brett and Emily McGinn on different ways to approach teaching with data. Emily gave a breezy introduction to teaching computational thinking with an activity called “Asking Questions of Data: How to Think Like a Computer” and Megan shared a minimal exercise for helping students to construct data from primary documents called “Thinking About Historic Data.” I’m enjoying the talks and also pleased that we hit upon a workflow for giving the presentations afterlives: after the event folks are updating their presentations to Knowledge Commons and sharing back citations for us to collect in one place. Future-proofed, professionally legible pedagogy.
The next snack-sized digital pedagogy is titled “On Making” and will feature Jajwalya Karajgikar and Amanda Licastro on Friday, April 4th 2025 from 1:00-2:00PM EST. More information about their planned contributions:

Jajwalya Karajgikar, Applied Data Science Librarian, University of Pennsylvania Library
    
Blurb: When we consider library services and patrons in higher education, we typically think of resources, databases, and other mechanisms for the transfer of knowledge. More difficult to encapsulate is the sense of community building that occurs in the library as an impartial space for technology, information literacy, and campus well-being. This is the function of many research data, digital scholarship, and maker-space centers within the library. This short talk elaborates on collaborative projects that facilitate the development of deep relationships with people on campus through Slow Process Making and Embodied Critical Making.


Amanda Licastro, Head of Digital Scholarship Strategies and Visiting Associate Professor in English at Swarthmore College
    
Blurb: Interested in introducing your students to the world of #DHMakes? This presentation will review a series of scaffolded workshops aimed at making space for humanists in the Makerspace. With a focus on building critical collaborations across campus, audience members will gain practical tips on how to design hands-on, creative assignments with public-facing products. The culminating example will be an exhibit created by students in my undergraduate English course inspired by sci-fi literature, surveillance theory, and archival objects from Special Collections.



Register to join us for the second snack-sized event on zoom. And please get in touch using our form if you would like to share your own work at a future session. I’m excited to see where this series goes!
More snacks soon.

Job ads in higher education are confusing. This is especially true of digital humanities positions that can combine multiple positions—faculty, staff, student—into one. Students might have a particularly hard time decoding these job ads. I often find that the fellows I work with need some help learning to read and decipher these postings so they can feel confident seeking out and applying for their first DH job. The Association for Computers in the Humanities sometimes runs panels designed to discuss these skills. I thought I would share my own professional development activity that I often run with students to build this literacy.
You will need:

Three printed DH job ads
    
This can be tricky, as most job ads disappear once they are filled. You can still find some evidence of a posting here or there from organizations that crosspost them outside of the institutional HR site. H-net has a series of job listings, for example, and Code4Lib does not seem to take down their copies of old jobs. I think it works well to have different kinds of jobs in the mix - one faculty, one administrator, and one programer position, for example.


A space for conversation
    
If it’s just you and one other person you could go for coffee. Otherwise I could imagine this working in small groups.


60 minutes for the activity

From there, I have students spend roughly 10 minutes looking at a job and 10 minutes discussing it before repeating twice more for the other two positions. As they move through, I ask students what they notice about each job:

What seems consistent?
What is different about each position?
What is confusing?
What would make them confident applying to it?

As I go, I balance the students’ reflections with my own, and I try to guide the conversation around a specific set of topics that students are most likely to need help understanding: qualifications, responsibilities, the institutional history, and the ethics of the job. Below I share some of the things I try to point out in those conversations.
Qualifications
While qualifications often aren’t the first part of a job posting, they’re frequently the thing that students gravitate towards when seeing an ad for the first time. I think this comes from a position of anxiety. Students often are insecure in their own qualifications, and so they see a list of skills and methods and immediately feel like they don’t qualify. So some familiarity in how to understand lists of qualifications might be helpful. To begin, I often tell students to look for specific words like “and” or “or.” Does the job ask for Python, R, and JavaScript? Or does the job ask for just one of the three? Sometimes, this might even be worded as “the ability to solve technical problems with a programming language of your choice.” These distinctions might seem small, but they are often an indicator of whether or not a job is looking for a unicorn—a position that wants you to be expert in everything under the sun. In a list that asks for one or two skills out of a list you can often take them at their word. Pay attention to whether the job gives you opportunity to not know everything.
I often describe a DH job as consisting of many different kinds of buckets where each category corresponds to specific topics or methods. Some examples of these might include critical making, text analysis, 3D modeling, GIS, programming, database design, digital archives, or more. Together, in some combination, these buckets make up a job. A person. No one will actually have expertise in every single one of these things. But most professional DHers are familiar some arrangement of them and expert in a smaller subset. I often encourage students to think of themselves in these terms when starting out: identify one specific area of expertise and and then several more for familiarity.1 I encourage the students to see the big buckets. What are they familiar with? What do they have expertise in? Sometimes a job posting will list “preferred qualifications,” a handy way to directly map the job needs to your own hierarchy of familiarity and expertise. I encourage students not to be dismayed if the position in front of them does not match up to their own profile. Instead, think about how they can develop a plan to grow the timeframe that they have. They might not fit this job, but they can have the right buckets next time.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities for a position are often where you can find out what the job will actually be doing, so it can be helpful to read these in conversation with the listed skills and qualifications. Sometimes they will give you a sense of what skills are actually likely to be key and which are more icing on the cake. If the qualifications don’t seem to line up to the responsibilities that’s probably an indication that the job might be an untenable one, or that it might be pulled in too many directions. Approach these gigs with caution.
Digital Humanities positions can be a whole broad range of things. Sometimes the job titles aren’t very descriptive. You might see something like a DH specialist, a DH coordinator, a DH librarian, and those words don’t necessarily tell you a lot about the specific institutional needs for that position. The same job title can mean very different things at different places. The responsibilities are where you were more typically find more about what would actually be asked of you. Sometimes the descriptions of responsibilities are not especially helpful. They might list things like “responsible for collaborating with faculty,” “teaches a variety of workshops,” or other kinds of generic descriptors that might only give you a general indication of what the job is. Sometimes, you’ll be luckier. An ad might list the specific projects that you would be directly involved in overseeing and implementing, as in “responsible for the development and maintenance of a digital archive of XYZ.” Those are things to note and to speak to in a cover letter and interview. But even if they aren’t explicitly listed in the position description you can often do some research on the institutional history to fill out what is left unsaid. More below.
Institutional History
Now we’re getting into a place where humanities research skills can really shine. While the institutional history of a position often isn’t technically a specific part of the job description, it can teach you an awful lot. You can learn a lot by by exploring a series of questions:

Is this job a new job?
Is it re-hiring someone who left?
Is it for a grant?

You can often find some of this information by looking back at an organization’s website, on their blog, event pages, and more. Did someone seem to be in this role before that you can identify? While position re-hires are often opportunities to rethink what a particular job does, you can get a lot of valuable information by trying to flag exactly what the previous person in this position was doing. What kind of projects and events did they seem to be talking about? Those were likely their direct work responsibilities, and you can sometimes map those directly onto what the new job is asking of you. While you might not want to speak with full confidence in a cover letter, you could reference the history of the work this role seemed to do in a way that shows your familiarity with the institution. Similarly, if the job appears new, that would seem to suggest that the institution is committing to a new kind of work. Does the job correspond to specific initiatives or efforts? Sometimes this information will be in the job description directly. If the position is grant-funded you can often find that information either in the job description itself or in a grant announcement. If the grant was specifically awarded for a digital archiving project, you can assume that digital archiving skills are likely to be essential for it. Whereas if they are hiring for a DH generalist and list digital archives as just one of many responsibilities, you can assume that such work will just be one of many things you would take on. This kind of information can help you to assess how qualified you are, how to talk about specific elements from your background, and whether or not the job is for you.
On Job Ethics
Given my own convictions about labor transparency and ethics, I like to point out any potential issues with the jobs we are looking at. Are we looking at a job with a fixed term? Is it renewable? Is the salary livable? Does it seem to be doing too much? Is this a job that has been posted many times and never filled? Is the institution known to be toxic? Some of this will only come with experience in the field, but you can also give the students a bit of literacy in how to perform a smell test of a particular job ad. Of course, each individual will have their own set of circumstances to weigh when applying to any given position. And a one-year, fixed position might make a lot of sense for someone who is local. But I always want to make sure that students know the issues with jobs like these and how untenable they can be. We often don’t locally advertise jobs to our students in the Lab if they don’t pass the smell test unless we know of people whose specific goals and geographic limitations match up with a particular opportunity. At the very least, we want to make sure that students enter into the job search with eyes open.

There is much more to say, of course, but hopefully this quick writeup gives someone out there the tools they need to run this activity for themselves. I find that it helps to demystify the DH job market for students and helps them feel empowered to take that next step themselves. Perhaps most importantly, it starts to peel back obscuring layers of HR-ness and starts to make DH as a professional field a bit more transparent. That’s often the first step towards students feeling more invited into the professional community, and it can help them make a plan for developing the kind of institutional profile that they will need to apply successfully in the future.

What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. You can find book-related posts here. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email at bmw9t@virginia.edu.

This is a book about teachers, the labor they take on, and the structures that prevent them doing that work well. Our institutions often define teaching as something that happens in specific spaces, at specific times, and by specific people. In higher education, positions are often described with a common shorthand: “I teach a 2-2” or “I carry a 4-4.” The formulation describes both a calendar distribution as well as the supposed burden of teaching. Once your courses are done—your course load carried—you can get back to work. And the implicit encouragement is to spend less time on teaching and more time on your tenure file. The classroom is a space to be escaped. And when we describe some positions and institutions as teaching-intensive, however true the designation might be, we create boundaries. We suggest that some spaces are for teaching and some not.
Staff positions often distribute identification with the craft of teaching in a similar way. A Teaching and Learning Librarian might explicitly focus on classroom instruction. An Undergraduate Success Librarian might specialize in undergraduate outreach. Some roles might work with patrons directly to answer questions and roles, while others might think of themselves more as back of house and removed from the community. As with faculty positions and their associated teaching responsibilities, the ways we distribute staff labor can suggest separation between those who teach and those who do not. Some are in the classroom, while others might never set foot in it.
But we all teach.
It is understandable that someone without explicit classroom responsibilities might see themselves as disconnected from the act of teaching. But we do ourselves and our students a disservice when we fail to recognize the teaching that takes place across the institution by instructors in a range of different job titles. This book specifically speaks from the point of view of the teaching librarian, in part, because library positions entail a range of types of interaction. In some cases, librarians might design for-credit courses as part of the curriculum. But so much of the work of librarianship takes place in other spaces: reference consultations, collaborations with faculty members, one-on-one mentoring, workshops, one-off instructional sessions, and more. To be a librarian is to dance along the cracks of the institution, engaged in a thousand small teaching acts. Because of this, library perspectives are helpful for illuminating the cross-cutting impact of pedagogical decisions.
In the same way that teaching occurs throughout the university, staff positions like those in the library are useful case studies for discussing the pedagogies of institutions because they are regularly called upon to engage in the infrastructure of the university. Even if their job titles do not contain the word “administrator,” staff positions often make policy decisions that affect others. Digital humanities library positions, in particular, expose the ways in which teaching is an intersection of pedagogy and policy. Throughout this book I use the term teaching administrator to refer to individuals inhabiting such complicated roles in places of higher education. The term refers to those faculty and staff who inhabit administrative roles within their respective institution but also provide instruction in some capacity. I use the term administrator quite liberally here: it refers not only to directors or managers but more broadly to anyone engaged in the inner workings of university infrastructure and making policy decisions for it. Teaching, too, is construed broadly. Teaching takes place throughout the university, in its cracks and its hallways, in all manner of forms. The teaching administrator might direct a center but teach a course periodically. They might be a GIS Specialist who also runs regular workshops. Or they might be a developer engaged in paired programming with a student as part of a project development. Teaching administrators, no matter their specific job title, regularly find themselves implicated in and exerting force upon the various policies and norms that work on the institution and, in so doing, upon their embedded pedagogies.
More specifically, this is a book about all those principles, practices, and structures that intersect in a kind of pedagogy in the institution around them. When a local government reduces its budget, forcing secondary educators to dip into the own bank accounts to pay for classroom supplies—that is an observable act that impacts pedagogy. The material conditions of the classroom are changed based on administrative choices that are removed from the classroom. When the chairs in a public classroom are welded to the floor so as to prevent them from being moved from neatly arranged rows—that is a kind of pedagogy. The decision to bolt chairs to the ground may never have been made with actual instruction in mind, but it nonetheless affects the possibilities for learning in that space. The university encourages the idea that teaching takes place in the classroom, and this mode of thinking is a function of policy, power, and politics. When conversations are not explicitly about teachers and students—a kind of pedagogy is still being enacted. After all, an absence can still be noted and remarked upon. Why aren’t we talking about teaching? What does it say about what we value instead? A pedagogy.
This is a book about administrative choices like these, about the ways in which they help or harm the teachers in their midst. About all the myriad ways in which the work of education is routinely damaged by forces outside the classroom. This book argues that these institutional norms, policies, and structures act as embedded pedagogies that are operationalized for or against teachers and learners. Most often, as in the case of budgets cuts or prescriptive classroom spaces, these institutional pedagogies put teachers on the back foot, forced to teach in ways they might not otherwise do so in part out of a survival instinct. The first step to finding our way to the teaching we want to see in our work is to recognize the obstacles facing that labor, the pedagogies running counter to our own. And it can be especially difficult to notice the things affecting our teaching when they happen far outside the classroom, carried out by those who don’t consider themselves educators. By recasting institutional activities and actors in pedagogical terms, I hope to empower teachers to find their own path to enduring administrative difficulties even as they work to change them. These embedded pedagogies can be especially challenging to work against because the pressures they exert are often invisible to the teachers and learners in their midst. The first tactical decision we can make to counter them is to render them known.
Universities invest vast resources in making themselves known to their students, their communities, and their publics, from marketing to branding, communications to legislative testimony. In the process, though, this knowability is limited by design, as elite universities necessarily want themselves to be only so known, in specific ways, and by particular people. Institutions frequently obscure their actual administration in ways that distance teachers from their core functions. This web of policies, practices, and pressures shape our ability to teach and learn in seen and unseen ways, forming the network of embedded institutional pedagogies. By rendering these opaque practices transparent, we can empower educators to intervene in the forces affecting their ability to do the work of teaching.
In a certain way this book was also my own attempt to chart a pathway to survival in the face of the embedded pedagogies of my own institution. During a period of administrative upheaval at my place of work, blogging became a way for me to vent and reflect about the challenges I found for supporting student work. The audience I found for this writing seemed to be largely people in positions like mine: mid-career digital humanities administrators who had a hand in research, teaching, and administration. Positions like these are sometimes called “alt-ac” for the ways in which they offer a landing for graduate students outside of the traditional faculty path. Alt-ac staff often refer to themselves as scholar practitioners, a phrase that further serves to illuminate the fact that we often see administrative praxis itself as a subject for research and critique in its own right. The term “teaching administrator” is a similar riff, both a description of a hybridized identity and an attempt to instrumentalize it.
In moments of despair I sometimes referred to this manuscript as “the book I’m writing about bullshit and how to deal with it.” Invariably, others would respond with their own, similar frustrations at their own institutions. Embedded pedagogies carry power, in part, because they refuse to be seen for what they are. Writing this text is a first attempt at making legible the relationship between administrative policy and teaching in a way that makes them visible. To describe what I see so others can notice as well. To know and be known. To use the unique position of the teaching administrator to push back on the limited knowability of the institution and render legible its embedded pedagogies.

I’m realizing that if I don’t start combining things I will only ever blog about my class, so here I’m collecting notes on the last two weeks of “Data for the Rest of Us” on data description and collection into a single post. We got into the first real technical skills for the course as the students built out their understanding of the data production pipeline. The goal is for them to build datasets based around their own interests, and we took some real steps in that direction with these units.
We had previously developed a working definition of data, so we began our session on description by reviewing it briefly before quickly introducing metadata. We focused on its use: confusingly, metadata is often called data about data, but it’s more accurately thought of as data attached to other data that gives context, facilitates discovery, and enables analysis. We got to these topics by way of metadata in everyday life. We talked about the metadata categories used on driver’s licenses and by online booksellers to facilitate identification and search. And then we made our way to the Netflix page for a popular movie to show how fuzzy things can get. I pointed out the various objective, quantifiable data (release date, length) and asked the students to discuss the other kinds of qualitative data on the page. We discussed how the genre categories are often a combination of algorithmically generated and hand-selected tags. We talked about controlled vocabulary, introduced the concept of a folksonomy, and discussed the pros and cons of each. Relevant examples were hashtags on Twitter and shelving categories on Goodreads. We ended by discussing metadata standards with a particular focus on Dublin Core.
Then we moved to the actual main activity for the day that actually asked the students to practice creating descriptive metadata. I set out three stacks of materials and asked them in groups to create a spreadsheet describing them. Each set of materials had a few types of items:

A set of books that were easy to describe
A zine
A book by George Eliot
A book by Haruki Murakami (to introduce concepts of translation)
One of a handful of especially challenging objects:
    
a CD of regional GIS information
the deck-of-cards novel Riding SideSaddle by Miriam Suzanne
the Surviving Design Projects deck



I had the students go through and describe their objects in groups using Dublin Core, fielded questions as they came up, and then rotated the unusual objects so that each group had seen them all. I periodically asked discoverability questions that prompted the students to rethink how they were organizing their data such as “which of you has a book by Mary Ann Evans?” The answer, of course, is that they all had a book by George Eliot. We talked about where that information should go in their dataset and discussed the individual choices made by different groups to solve these problems. We then touched on Riding SideSaddle specifically, which gave every group difficulty. Was the novel a genre? A format? A fuzzy concept? Their homework to pull all this together by using Dublin Core to create a small dataset that described 10 different examples of an interest of theirs.
The following class was about data collection, a topic I was especially excited about. We talked broadly about why we want to gather that in the first place:

It’s not being done!
To make the world better
To make something you care about last
Because otherwise someone else will do it instead/in spite of you

And then we discussed how to do so:

Surveys
Crowdsourcing
Web scraping
APIs
Ethics questions and IRB

Throughout, my main takeaway was that there is a wealth of stuff out there not being gathered. Any person can take on the task of gathering ephemeral content, sustaining, and analyzing it. But we have to be careful, ethical, and thoughtful about how we do so.
The centerpiece of the class was a workshop on webscraping as a method for collecting web data. I love teaching students how to scrape because I still remember how earth shattering it felt to learn how to do for the first time. So much stuff out there! And you can reach out to touch and handle it! I don’t assume any programming knowledge in the course, so I looked around for point-and-click scraping tools that might work for a one-off workshop. I landed on webscraper.io, a freemium tool that runs as an extension in Chrome. It’s very slick and powerful for this sort of sandbox work. The free version runs locally in your browser, so not good for full-on, large-scale work. But it requires very little technical knowledge, which made it work well for my purposes. I walked the students through how to scrape the Scholars’ Lab blog, and then I gave them a few other sites to practice with:

https://books.toscrape.com/
https://quotes.toscrape.com/
https://webscraper.io/test-sites

Their homework was to scrape another sandbox example and come up with ideas for real scraping projects. They’ve done great work with these scaffolding assignments that are building towards pitches for their final projects, and I’m excited to see where they go.
A few other reflections:

I keep having the students make spreadsheets to work with, and every time the students lose five minutes at the beginning of each activity as they create a blank spreadsheet and share their email addresses with each other. I should really create some blank spreadsheets ahead of time for them to reuse. It’s a small thing, but a few minutes each class really add up. And it often feels like the activities have a slow burn to really get going as the students start out engaging in tedious housekeeping.
One small thing I’ve been interested in this semester: everyone in the class is majoring or minoring in STEM in some way. I’m finding that I have to recalibrate a lot of my expectations. For example, my own background as a teacher of literature makes me want to gear everything towards discussion in a way that feels unusual to the students. But the students are excelling with the hands-on activities and technical work. I’m finding that I need to lecture more than normal, but also that I can go deeper on some of the technical questions than I might otherwise.

As always, the slide decks I’ve put together are all available on the course website.

I keep my running CV on my website for a few reasons. It keeps everything in one place. It’s handy to point students towards when they have questions about how to list things on their own CV. It lets me pull in some quick stats on my blog posts using Jekyll. But I’ve always run into problems when it comes time to submit my CV as an actual document. Copying the page over to Microsoft Word brings in all the detritus of my web styling and structure, and I have to dutifully edit those elements out before submission.
I described this problem to Jeremy Boggs, our Head of R&D, and he immediately suggested that I look into making a print stylesheet for my CV page. I knew you could use CSS to style the ways your web page gets printed, but I’d never actually played around with it before. Now I’ve got things going such that I have far less to do when I go to submit my CV. This post documents that process.
The first thing I needed to do was get a way to preview what I was looking at. By default, your developer environment won’t render your print styles unless you go to print a page and look at the preview that pops up. I followed this set of instructions for getting Google Chrome to emulate my print styles in the browser as I worked.
Now that I can see my work, my first real step is to make a new print stylesheet and link it to my site in the head of my default template. This print stylesheet is fairly specialized to a single page, so I wrap the reference in an if statement so that it is only included on that particular page.
_includes/head.html
{% if page.title == "CV" %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/styles/print.css">
{% endif %}

Now that the stylesheet is included, I start to build up a styles/print.css file one piece at a time based on the things I want to change. First off was hiding web-only materials like the nav bar and the masthead.
styles/print.css
  /* Hide web-only content  */
  header, nav, h1.page-title, #web-title{
    display: none;
  }

But I actually do want some material as a masthead. I implement this by actually having some content on the web that is only rendered to the browser if it is printed. This becomes a part of the masthead, contained in my default layout for my jekyll site.
_layouts/default.html
<div class="print-only" id="print-title">Brandon Walsh | walsh.brandon.michael@gmail.com | @walshbr</div>

And then it only appears when printed by specifying a print-only class for those elements that I only want when printing.
styles/print.css
  .print-only{
    /* Display print-only content */
    display: block;
  }

The web version of my CV does not span the whole width of the page, which is good for readability on the web but a problem when printing. So these settings create a more typical one-inch margin for the document. Another interesting issue I ran into was that some printers by default will include metadata - date, page number, time - on the page for printing. The margin settings below cut that off.
styles/print.css
  div.container.content {
    /* normalize content sizing for printing */
    max-width: none !important;
  }

  @page {
    /* hide printer-specific information that would otherwise get added */
    margin:0;
    padding: 1in;
  }

And then finally I got down to the actual task of setting up some basic stylings that make it a little less web and a little more print. I switch fonts, change the text size, and revert to default URL text decorations for the sake of the genre. In the past I’ve found that my link styles, especially, look very strange when copied over to a print document.
styles/print.css
  html, h2, h3, #print-title{
    /* set print-ready font and text size */
      font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; 
      font-size: 12px;
  }

  a{
    /* Normalize URL colors */
      text-decoration: underline;
      color: blue;
  }

One stretch goal that I haven’t fully implemented: I commonly need a quick way to cut my CV down. There’s no good way to do it programmatically with any real level of precision, but Jeremy showed me how to do a rough cut that works well in a pinch. I’m using Jekyll by default, which will give ID’s to all of my headers that match the titles. Jeremy showed me how to use CSS selectors to selectively hide whole batches of content based on those ID’s. The following CSS would hide all of my service commitments. Not really super useful to do a lot of, but maybe helpful to know about!
styles/print.css
/* example for how to hide specific sections */
/* 
h2#professional-service-and-affiliations,
h2#professional-service-and-affiliations+ul,
h3#local-service-washington-and-lee,
h3#local-service-washington-and-lee+ul,
h3#local-service-university-of-virginia+ul{
  display:none;
} */

That’s it for now. Much more that I could do, but this serves my needs nicely. And here’s a quick side-by-side of the first printed page to see how the new print.css sheet stacks up.
First the original print, which is a pretty close copy of the web version:

And now the new one with a print stylesheet incorporated. Much more usable as a CV! I could save it as a PDF to submit.

I’ve pasted the full contents of all the relevant files as they stand in case you’re interested in replicating.
_includes/head.html
{% if page.title == "CV" %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/styles/print.css">
{% endif %}

_layouts/default.html
<div class="print-only" id="print-title">Brandon Walsh | walsh.brandon.michael@gmail.com | @walshbr</div>

styles/print.css
@media print {
  
  /* Hide web-only content  */
  header, nav, h1.page-title, #web-title{
    display: none;
  }

  .print-only{
    /* Display print-only content */
    display: block;
  }

  div.container.content {
    /* normalize content sizing for printing */
    max-width: none !important;
  }

  @page {
    /* hide printer-specific information that would otherwise get added */
    margin:0;
    padding: 1in;
  }

  html, h2, h3, #print-title{
    /* set print-ready font and text size */
      font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; 
      font-size: 12px;
  }

  a{
    /* Normalize URL colors */
      text-decoration: underline;
      color: blue;
  }

/* example for how to hide specific sections */
/*

h2#professional-service-and-affiliations+ul,
h3#local-service-washington-and-lee,

}

Amanda Visconti and I are starting a series of process experiments with public writing, where the goal is to experiment with format and mode while still attempting to get a public piece done in a single hour. For this first session we sat together, read some intentions and affirmations to set the tone, and then pulled from the Oblique Strategies card deck to get a prompt for us each to write on. The card Amanda chose hit me in the gut:
What mistakes did you make last time?
Given everything going on in the news right now, it’s impossible not to read this in light of the new presidential administration, which has just released a flurry of executive actions and destabilizing edicts designed to harm, divide, and panic. It feels like history rhyming, this time with capital letters. The first Trump administration felt excruciating and devastating in all sorts of ways, and this one already feels worse. I have been thinking endlessly about the memory of the last time, whether or not the work that we do in digital humanities matters in this context, and how we might make it matter more. It’s easy to despair.
What mistakes did you make last time?
In some ways, the quote rings to me of the cruelty of living in the past—exactly the sort of thing my therapist tells me not to do. “Don’t ruminate,” she would say, warning me against endlessly turning over in my mind the mistakes I made, the alternate timelines that didn’t manifest. It’s not enough to just warn oneself against worrying about past mistakes, though, and my therapist always goes on: “instead lean into your toolkit and all the work you have done to prepare yourself to deal with these challenging situations.” You are prepared for this. It is not the same, because you are not the same.
What mistakes did you make last time?
This is not business as usual, but the business of the usual carries on. The sun still rises. Care still must be given to those who need it. Work must still be done. There is an absurdity to this disconnect while the world increasingly aches with fire, death, and pain. I see in the card an invitation to the future, to dream of a better world than the one we have, to think beyond mistakes and towards rewriting the equation by different rules. We all have levers to pull to work against these forces each day. Last time was different because I was different. This difference can multiply. The math of dreamers, creating a world beyond the present crisis through the mundane work of small, everyday acts.
Who were you last time? Who are you now? Who will you be tomorrow?
Dream math. Pencils ready.

Snow is on the ground, but I bundled up to make it to campus for week two of “Data for the Rest of Us,” a semester-long, two-credit introduction to data literacy from a humanities perspective. The general arc of the course takes students through all parts of the data construction pipeline and culminates in small groups developing datasets based around their own interests to share back with the class. This week’s topic was “Data Identification,” which I structured in two segments: theory and practice.
First, we developed a working definition of what qualifies as data. Core to this was the Wikipedia page for data, which offers a neat and actionable summary in the first paragraph: “Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə, US also /ˈdætə/ DAT-ə) are a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.”
For our purposes, I simplified this definition as containing three key elements. Data is…

A collection
of units of meaning
that may be interpreted formally.

We discussed each of these pieces separately:

What counts as a collection? Who is doing the collecting? What does it mean to arrange things together? What structures facilitate collection or collecting? When does data become a dataset?
What counts as a unit of meaning? What is meaning in the humanities? What are the humanities anyway? What kinds of meaning units have we used in the past week?
What do we mean by formal interpretation? In this case, I specifically referred to the kinds of interpretation made possible by computers. We talked about what computers are good at, what they are bad at, and the kinds of compromises we might have to make to move between the two. We also talked about the kinds of formal interpretations that are possible: mapping, pattern recognition, averages, counting, and more.

In the second phase of the course, we practiced putting this definition into practice. I presented a series of objects to the students and asked them to apply our definition to it. Did this count as data on our terms? That is…was it a collection of meaningful information that could interpreted quantitatively? Why or why not? What units of information were there that could become data? How would we structure things if we wanted to convert this into data as defined above, such that we could work with it computationally?
We looked at:

A spreadsheet with stuff in it
An empty spreadsheet
An apple watch loaded with personal metrics
A diagram of cell phone metadata describing call counts, shortest paths between phones
data structures
A bookcase with books in it
The bible opened to a particular page
A movie poster
A set of movie posters
A Wikipedia page about a Civil War battle
A spreadsheet full of information about twentieth-century wars
The front page of Vogue

Some conversations were less lively, but there were some objects that brought out great observations. With the Bible, for example, students noted how certain structural elements like chapter number, verse number, and page number might be interesting units of meaning you might want to preserve. And they got there by noting how you cite material from it. I also talked a bit about the OCR process by way of orienting them towards the path by which a physical object might become a collection of words in a plain text file.
The other “this is not a pipe” moment came when I asked the students to talk about what was contained in a movie poster. After they named all the textual elements of the image, I pulled up the CSS Color Picker tool and talked about how images are also specific organizations of color data. So in addition to the textual information we understood as people, the computer was understanding things on a very visual level and in very quantified terms. This made a nice link to the Robots Reading Vogue project and brought out a discussion of how we can make meaningful interpretations from visual information.
We closed with a short discussion of “On Missing Data Sets” by way of encouraging the students to think about what is out there, what is not, and the kinds of values, systems, and resources that go into deciding what is collected and what is not. For homework, the students have to brainstorm some datasets that don’t exist that they are interested in. I’m, frankly, a little suspicious of how successful they will be at this. It seems very hard to me! But I wanted to throw them the challenge to see how they do. Even if they struggle mightily I think it will be worthwhile.
If I had to run this particular class again, I probably would divide the class into smaller groups to help facilitate discussion. We ultimately got where I wanted to go, but my sense was that the students might have needed a bit more help from me structuring the discussion to get there. I think that might have been accomplished by flipping the format - rather than a group discussion about particular topics and images, I would give each group a set of images and a set of questions to answer about them before we came back to discuss. I’m still finding my way in this class of all STEM students since I’m used to exclusively teaching humanities majors.
Overall, the class discussion sent the students into something of an existential tailspin. Is it data? Yes. But also no. Could be! Depends on how much work you want to put into the question. And much more of that work is to come.

This semester, I’m teaching an undergraduate course at UVA called “Data for the Rest of Us.” The course is, broadly, an attempt to introduce principles and practices of critical data literacy to students who might otherwise find full-blow data science intimidating. I’ve published the whole course online, and I’ll likely be posting some reflections off and on as the course proceeds. The centerpiece of the course is the group construction of a dataset and associated narrative description based on their research interests, an outcome that I’m largely basing on Responsible Datasets in Context. Much more to say about the design of the course as a whole, but I wanted to document a little about the first day today. If RDiC is where the inspiration for the course came from, I’ve had the first day’s activity in my head just as long. I planned to introduce myself and the course in a few minutes before quickly shifting gears into something I called “We Data.” Here’s the prompt:

We Data: An Icebreaking Activity
I want to get to know you. In the spirit of the course, your job is to make a dataset about yourselves to share back with me. You have 45 minutes in which to do so. You have to hit the following buckets.

Identify your data

Who are you?


Describe your data

What are you interested in describing as a part of your dataset? What are you not?


Collect

Gather your data in one place.


Clean

Edit the dataset so that it’s in a presentable, consistent format.


Analyze

What stories are in your dataset?


Distribute

How will you share it back to me?



Some advice

Not everyone has to work on the same things! Divide up.
Use what you have.
Don’t spend so much time talking. Do.


The goal was to introduce the students to the pipeline we will follow in the course as we develop skills in data management and construction: Identification, Description, Collection, Cleaning, Analysis, Distribution. These are the units the course follows, so the activity mirrors the work they will do on their final project while introducing some of the same questions and topics. I also hoped it would serve a lot of the same function as a more traditional set of icebreakers, with the added hope that the activity would feel a little more connected to the course than such things might otherwise.
I thought it went pretty well all things considered! A few thoughts and reflections follow while they are fresh in my mind:

I mostly spent the 45 minutes of the activity floating among the groups, using the opportunity to practice names, get to know each group, and engage with students about their responses. I also took care to watch the clock and encourage people to move on to different parts of the activity’s pipeline at certain stages.
The students took some prodding to talk as a group rather than spend the time quietly inputting things in sheets on their own. But this also might be due to the fact that the students spent a few minutes at the start setting up Google Sheets to collaborate on—once everyone had everyone’s email addresses they were off.
Given the way the course was pitched, I expected some folks to have questions about what a dataset was. I was a bit surprised to see how quickly people immediately jumped to Google Sheets. It turned out that the vast majority of my students come from STEM or the social sciences, and this disciplinary background might have something to do with how quickly and easily they dove right into working on the project.
As I had hoped, the students started with objective facts (siblings, name, major, etc.). As time wore on, they found their way to much more subjective and interesting questions (favorite book, favorite tv show, favorite snack). Some even wound up in philosophical territory: “what would be your answer to the trolley problem?”
The students noted that much of their data wound up being a mix of textual and numerical information, though one group shared dog photos in the spreadsheet. I might have a hand in encouraging this delightful bit of chaos.
For the analytical section, the students mostly narrated their way through the stories that their group’s datasets told about themselves. But one group—admittedly the one that happened to have two stats majors—actually produced graphs! They shared some scatter plots, pie charts, and even showed a map where they plotted their hometowns.

The activity concluded with the students sharing back their group’s datasets and analysis with each other. I followed this with a general discussion of the activity using the following guiding questions:

What is data?
What is it not?
What was hard?
What did you learn?
How did it feel to represent yourselves in this way?

One thing that came up was the students’ willingness to share personal data and not worry too much about it. For one, nothing they shared was all that sensitive. Several students connected this comfort to the general pervasiveness of technological surveillance in their daily life. If just about anything can be found online, why sweat any small thing too much? Even knowing that this was a specific response to an isolated activity, the conversation was an interesting window into how differently younger generations view privacy and personal data.
I’ll definitely be using a version of the same activity in future semesters. Onward!

One thing that helped me a lot as a graduate student was the Scholars’ Lab’s willingness to aid me in preparing for job interviews. I had no idea what to expect, so the practice was hugely beneficial for me—as was the coaching in what a mock interview might look like at all. Now that I’m on the other side of the table and offering them myself, I thought I would document how I run mock interviews in case the information is useful for others.
The Process
You’ll first want to assemble 1-2 other interviewers for your mock committee. Part of the strangeness of interviews is the discomfort of managing a one-sided conversation. You’ll want to mirror that for students if you can. Since interview—and, accordingly, mock interview—requests come up very last minute, it’s helpful to know who in your community might be interested in participating in the process. I often find staff are very happy to accommodate these last-minute requests once they have done them once, but giving them a bit of a heads up that they are in the pool of potential interviewers can help encourage participation in the future. I also try to select people likely to be familiar with the kind of job in question, so pre-gathering a pool of participants can help you identify areas in which you could use some help.
Once you have the group together, share the following documents with them ahead of time:

the position description
the student’s job materials
the plan for the mock interview (including questions to ask)

In an ideal world the committee will familiarize themselves with all the relevant materials, though since these things are often scheduled last minute I never assume this is the case. I usually plan to convey a lot of the information verbally when we meet as a committee.
Schedule 90 minutes for the mock interview, though 60 minutes will work if necessary. I typically use this format:

10 minutes to brief on the plan for the session and give general interview thoughts
60 minutes for the mock interview
20 minutes to debrief, give feedback, and discuss

From there you should be ready to carry out the mock. More guidance follows about how to facilitate each specific part of the interview process for your student and your collaborators.
Part 1 of the Interview: Discussion of the Mock Plan
Since most students come to us without much experience at all interviewing, let alone for the subset of alt-ac or DH positions, I typically open with just a few minutes discussing interviews in general. I often note that these types of positions are not quite full academic positions and not quite standard tech jobs. Discussing the posting ahead of time might help to give students some sense of what they can expect, as each position is unique. For example, postdoctoral positions come in many flavors. Some might be more like pre-faculty fellowships, with a heavy focus on personal research in addition to staff responsibilities. Others might be more flavored as pre-staff positions with limited research time. Temper expectations accordingly with a bit of context about the position.
Plan to mirror the format of the interview—phone, Zoom, or in-person. It’s important to practice as though it were the real thing. Each format is awful in ways that can’t be anticipated ahead of time. I typically discuss the particular weirdness of the selected format with the student quite frankly. I have seen pretty shocking things in the background of zoom interviews before. It happens. Best not to be thrown but also keep in mind how you can minimize the risks of such things for yourself.
Many formal searches have HR requirements that require interviewers to ask the same questions of each candidate. These rules carry a lot of ramifications. Committee members might ask follow-up questions, but back and forth conversation is likely to be minimal. Interviewers might aggressively be taking notes while you talk. The committee will typically move person by person down the line and each read questions from a prepared list. These procedures can give the feeling that you have no real rapport with the people in the room because you get little response visually or verbally to much of what you say. All of this is to say: the awkwardness is not you. It is almost always a reflection of the format, where people are trying to figure out who should go when, who should say what, what to do next, etc. Expect it.
I usually close by asking the student to take the mock as seriously as they would a real interview, up to and including trying their best to stumble through answers as they would for the real thing. This means avoiding the temptation to pass on any one question with a response like “well I should probably think about that more.” Just do your best—we can discuss later.
Part 2 of the Interview: The Mock Itself
The bulk of the mock is spent on the actual interview. I usually offer a few options for the mock committee. Questions can be drawn from experience and made up on the spot if they like, but I also provide a bank of examples based around different topics for my colleagues to use if necessary. During the mock, we alternate who is asking questions to mimic the odd experience of interviewing by committee. And we try to draw from across a spectrum of topics. What follows is an example list of questions I have shared with colleagues in the past. Note the first and last questions common to each mock, followed by a series of different categories we can move among at will.

First Question
    
What drew you to this position? Why this place?


Position-specific Questions:
    
We are really concerned about X problem local to us. How would you address it? (I often research for five minutes and come up with something ahead of time.)
We want to get more undergrads involved. How would you do that?
How do you get faculty to collaborate meaningfully with staff?
Do you want to use this as a faculty steppingstone (ideally yes or no depending on the position)? How can we help?


Research Questions
    
Describe your research and what you think of as your primary intervention.
How does your dissertation engage in digital humanities?
If you had to construct a through line for your work—dissertation through extra-curricular activities—what would it be?
What is your next big project? (might be book, a DH project, etc.)


Teaching Questions
    
What is your vision for pedagogy (especially re: DH) and how we might integrate it here?
How might that be translated to a curriculum or minor?
How does DH inform your approach to teaching?
What DH teaching have you done?
If you were to teach a DH course for us what would it be?
What kind of support do you need for teaching?


Community Questions
    
How do you approach collaboration? (push to talk about both technical and project management strategies)
What experience do you have with grant writing? One problem we have is that when we write grants then the money ends. What do you do about that? How could you have this position help us (and you) grow?
How do you bring students into your program when you’re a multidisciplinary org like ours?
How do you build community and visibility on campus?


Technical Questions
    
We are interested in how you would begin to design a digital archive. Talk us through it.
Hand a list of dates that have been formatted differently - What do you see here? Why does this matter? How would you address it? (an actual interview question I had once!)
What did you learn from your biggest technical failure?


Last Question
    
Do you have any questions for us?



I could go on and on, but these are just meant as a starting point. I typically flavor the questions a bit towards the specific job in question. For example, a DH Developer mock might have more technical questions than an interview for a DH Specialist. But I do think giving a broad spectrum of questions, difficulties, and topics can be helpful for students as they try to figure out what they can expect. Often just seeing a big list of example questions like this can be enough to spark a student’s imagination as they continue to prep on their own.
Part 3 of the Interview: The Mock Debrief
Perhaps the most helpful piece of the mock is the feedback that students will receive from the committee. Each person will have their own things that they noticed, but I often find that there are a few points that students might especially need to hear advice on.
Because students often feel like imposters, it can be easy to overwhelm them with feedback. So, we often open debrief sessions simply by encouraging them. They survived. They can do this. Be careful to consider—and frame—your advice in the context of the circumstances. If the actual interview is the next day, a student cannot expect to change their personality wholesale based on your feedback—and advice to do so might just make the student panic. Instead, emphasize those things that feel doable and learnable in the time allotted.
One way to do this is to start with the good that you noticed in the mock performance. Were there specific questions they responded well to? Can you help them to extrapolate that performance to a more generalized approach? Were there responses where they felt particularly light on their feet? It’s easy to focus on the bad, so the students might need your help seeing their strengths. And opening with these moments can offer a healthy frame for the conversation to follow.
Students often lack confidence in their own experiences and their ability to speak from them to the job at hand. I always encourage students to think about their current identities as students as a kind of superpower. Staff and faculty putting together DH programming often have to work hard to reach out to students just like them. They’re living it! It’s just a matter of reframing their own experiences as expertise. What has worked for them in their own DH education? What has not? What lessons could they take elsewhere? They often know more than they might think!
I could offer much more in the way of specific advice that comes up repeatedly for students interviewing for DH jobs: contextualizing themselves as a PhD graduate applying for library work, saying enough for a particular question, saying too much, recognizing those questions that feel like traps, etc. But really I would just trust yourself and your students. In the same way that your students are capable of shining but might need the help to see it, I am confident that someone who has read this far in a post on this topic will have good instincts about what to share with a student about their interview performance.
Share all notes, guides, and questions (including those you didn’t ask) after the fact with the students for their own prep work. Follow up with the student close to the date and afterwards, both to encourage them and to find out how to better mirror the mock format to what they saw in reality.
Last Caveats
Some advice for readers of this post: know your own limits. I only have participated in so many kinds of search committees. Those I have served on primarily pertained to digital humanities, alt-ac, or library jobs. Other institutional contexts and types of positions will look different, in ways I cannot know. When I get a request for something more out of my wheelhouse—like a faculty position or an industry gig—I will try to pull in folks with experience in those contexts. Your university might also have a career center that could offer some advice on certain kinds of positions. Graduate students might not be their usual clientele, though, so they might need some orientation to the kinds of positions as well. I am always transparent with students about the limitations of my own experience and where they might need to look for advice from others.
Even with this final warning to recognize the limitations of your experiences and resources, I would encourage you to think expansively about how you can gather what you do have into useful professional development experiences for students. Students need all the help they can get as they try to apply for a broad range of opportunities in a toxic and unsettled job market. Your students will benefit from the effort you put into helping them prepare, especially for alt-ac or digital humanities positions that might feel a bit unusual for those less familiar with them.

Co-teaching is a promise. To each other. To yourself. To believe. To trust. To support. To help. To heal.
Co-teaching is not a weapon. Co-teaching is a gift.
Co-teaching is an act of love. It is not a competition.
Co-teaching is not a zero sum game.
Co-teaching is to see the world through the eyes of another. The classroom. Yourself.
Co-teaching is an act of vulnerability. To teach is to expose yourself.
Co-teaching is to invite someone in.
Co-teaching is an act of empathy.
Co-teaching is to extend your arms openly. It is not pushing someone away.
Co-teaching is a beautiful game. It is not a game of chance.
To teach is to learn. To co-teach is to learn to teach.
Co-teaching is embracing the unknown. To find yourself in the shoes of another.
To co-teach is to recognize that you have power.

I remember very clearly my flight back from the 2016 DLF Forum. I had presented with Mackenzie Brooks on open writing for Small Liberal Arts Colleges. My Facebook feed was full of photos of people voting in the US presidential election. Long lines. People putting one foot in front of another to vote. I flew back home on election night, and I remember the strange way that people in the airport started gathering around the television watching what was happening. Normally, people kept to themselves. That night, the anxiety in the air was palpable. As was the growing excitement (DLF, after all, was in Wisconsin that year). I remember the panic I felt flying and not knowing what would wait for me when we landed. When I got in my car and turned on NPR in a rush at 2:00 AM I first heard the results. I remember not being able to sleep.
In 2024, history rhymed. Conference week? Check. The ACH conference was the week of the election, and for months we had all wondered what the environment would feel like in the aftermath. We found out. Election results that were unexpected and, yet, all too expected? Check. At least this time I wasn’t on a flight: I could climb under the covers in my pajamas between sessions of the online conference.
I wrote both of my talks for this month’s ACH conference when Trump was just a second candidate. I helped to coordinate a workshop on articulating and defending the values at the core of your work with a whole raft of brilliant folks: Amanda Visconti, Caitlin Pollock, Pamella Lach, Kate Ozment, and Crystal Luo. Later that night, I gave a paper on speculative digital pedagogies with Seanna Viechweg, where we talked about the pasts, presents, and futures of imagination in the DH classroom. All of this work felt suddenly more urgent than ever. But I gave these talks in a stupor. As I spoke about advocacy and values I could not help but wonder about the limits and reaches of certain types of power. As I discussed the imagination and the future, I could not stop thinking about the past.
Did I still believe in what I was saying?
I’ve been thinking a lot about where I was eight years ago and where I am today. I’ve been at the Scholars’ Lab seven and a half years—roughly the span of the first Trump and the Biden presidencies. In that time, I have supervised dozens of students on a variety of projects. I have comforted them as they cried. Helped find them funding to survive. Worked to prepare them for and find them jobs. Advocated for them in spaces large and small. Organized alongside them in our wall-to-wall union. For some, this work helped. For others, it did not, and I remember every person for whom something didn’t pan out. I’ve learned hard lessons about the limits of my own ability to change things, and at times I’ve described the work as trying to steer a yacht through an obstacle course. You can correct the course slightly, but only so much. I’ve hit lots of buoys.
I believe in this work. I believe it has mattered. But eight years later I will confess to questioning a lot of its power. The words I was about to read to a digital space filled with other dazed people, all zooming in from their own rooms. They felt so small and insignificant. What good were my little words in the face of a country filled with hate, ready to visit and revisit new horrors on its population and on the world?
I recognize my own positionality. I am a cis white man with a comfortable job and salary. I do not face the same dangers to my bodily, financial, and political autonomy as so many who are most likely to be impacted by the new administration. Even so, I have so much fear. For my son’s future in a vaccine-skeptical world. For my LGBTQ friends and family who are worried about access to life-saving medication or the freedom to exist. For the immigrants in my life who are scared for their safety. My own anxieties and fears are a drop in the ocean, much wider and more vast.
As I was searching around for meaning and energy in the days following the election, I came across a few lights that I’ve been clinging to. As Josh Rezek posted on BlueSky, “Writing is part of surviving this! Your own and everyone else’s!” And my dear friend and collaborator Amanda Visconti shared a post by Brian LaRossa containing “a short thread full of words from people who are smarter than me about the vital role that artists play in society generally, and doubly so in the face of authoritarian regimes.” I don’t have any illusions that my own writing is as important or radical as the pieces linked in that thread. Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin. These are real heroes. I should be so lucky as to write anything a scrap as meaningful as what they produced. But these examples are helping me think less about where I was eight years in the past and more about where I want to be in the future. About the writer, teacher, and advocate that I want to continue growing into. And those heroes exist in the present, too, closer to home. Some of the most helpful conversations I have had in the week since the election have been with a pair of brilliant students with whom I share a DH writing group. They are more committed than ever to the pursuit of a better world. They teach me, as always, how to be better and how to help. And the work they produced these past few weeks moved me to tears (though I am a softy, to be fair).
By complete and total happenstance this is my hundredth post on my personal blog. Lots of little words. This post, then, is less a statement for others than it is for myself. A commitment to keep going in the face of fear. To keep growing. I will keep recognizing the limits of words and work to act beyond them. But I will also try to hold in my heart the belief that words carry power. So a week after the election and a bit better rested here I am. Putting one word after another. And recommitting myself to the regular practice of doing so.

The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. Consistent collaboration and engagement with the Scholars’ Lab community and staff is expected through the year. While residence on Grounds during the fellowship can help facilitate this, it is not required. Those who need to live elsewhere with periodic trips to campus should include in their cover letter a plan for how to ensure regular progress on the fellowship project.
We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $25,972 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $25,972 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
    
The funding packages for non-GSAS students operate on a different funding cycle and with different terms. As such, students outside of GSAS should confirm their eligibility with the Lab and their program director prior to applying.


Previously being a Praxis Fellow is not required. Nor is it a barrier. Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The student’s Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student’s application.
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue (no more than two pages);
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that holding the fellowship can affect teaching rosters);
and your availability for a 30-minute interview slot during the following times: 10:00AM-12:00PM EST on February 27. This should be communicated in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews.

The following is a short, internal lightning talk I gave to UVA Library staff as a part of the Library’s Open Access Week in fall 2024.

Hello! My name is Brandon Walsh, and I’m Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, one of the twin branches of the UVA Library’s Digital Humanities Center. I was asked to talk a bit about my work in open pedagogy as it intersects with digital humanities, a big baggy field in which we’re constantly confronting what we don’t know and helping others to do the same. From my earliest days working in DH, way back when I was a student myself in the Lab and in the Library, I was drawn to this pedagogical through line. The sheer importance of learning to it all. And this, in turn, has deeply informed how I approach Open with my students.
Always learning. Always teaching.
Together.
My practice of open digital pedagogy is informed by three intertwining principles:

Humanities students see themselves as imposters more often than not, particularly when it comes to technical concepts and methods.
Students are experts in teaching and learning. There is no one better equipped to explain something complicated than a person who has just learned it.
The labor of teaching and learning is often invisible.

My whole career has been about the commingling of these three concepts when it comes to pedagogy—self-confidence, expertise, and visibility.
Open has been the space in which they meet.
Often, this takes the shape of co-authored OER materials with my students. I co-wrote A Humanist’s Cookbook for Natural Language Processing in Python with Rebecca Bultman, then a UVA religious studies PhD. When I was a postdoc at Washington and Lee University, I co-wrote a course book on text analysis with Sarah Horowitz, a faculty collaborator who I was co-teaching with at the time. In each case, the process of co-writing, I hoped, would offer my partners a space to teach themselves something about the topic as well as the technical stack that it took to make it. They learned the terminal, Python, text analysis, markdown, version control, and more. I, in turn, learned to be a better teacher: the materials were much improved by having them involved as partners. The outcomes also presented this labor—the work of teaching and learning—in a space that was available to other learners and also CV-friendly. By positioning these student collaborators as co-writers, co-experts, I hoped to gently affirm that they were more than capable of doing this work. And the work aimed to present this new material in a space that would be more comfortable for humanists, grounding the learning process in public writing and conversation as opposed to pounding away at a programming script.
The production of open materials, by, for, and with students like these has always been a core part of my DH practice. Sometimes, as with these examples, the result explicitly looks like OER, but it’s often just about asking students to write in public about the process of teaching and learning. They teach themselves new techniques, develop workshops for each other, and document the teaching materials for others.  My students use open writing as a means of imagining into existence the kind of scholars they want to be on their own terms—they don’t wait for academic publishers to credential them accordingly. The examples I used here were specific to me, but virtually every member of the Scholars’ Lab staff is engaged in this work in some capacity. We want our students to see the Lab and the Library as spaces that see them for who they are—worthy and capable even as they are learning.
All of this is to say that open pedagogy for me means treating students as true partners in the production of scholarly knowledge. They teach me as much as I them, and it happens in public. I’ll close with a quotation by Nicholas Payton, a jazz hero of mine. It’s one I sit with every day.
“There are no great teachers, only great students who give tools to other students.”

This year, I am working with Rachel Retica and Seanna Viechweg on a digital pedagogy reading group (join us!). Our plan is to run a yearlong series of sessions, rotating who is in charge of any one meeting, as a means of giving each of us practice teaching at the same time that we’re discussing it. My first session focused on digital pedagogy and labor. Rachel’s session will focus on reading, interpretation and information literacy, and Seanna will run her session as a discussion of culturally responsive pedagogy. As a part of this work, we’ll also be aiming to work up a collectively authored piece at the end of the year. As we’re still in the brainstorming phase now, we decided to take on a series of writing prompts to gather some raw material to discuss our own orientations to this work.
Our first: what’s your origin story?
It was hard for me to come up with a single answer to the question, so I opted for a kind of refracting approach. Many sketches instead of a single one. I could not think of just one origin story, so I chose many. I wrote these all in chronological order, but I scrambled them at random to present them here. After all, I’m still that kid who cried in a trumpet lesson and skipped class in college, even now when I’m more often teacher than student. I’ll leave off reflections on them for another post.
What is your origin story with digital pedagogy? What brought you to it?
I am a student. I am quiet in class. I know whether or not I speak is tied to my grade, but I feel intense anxiety over this fact. It gets in the way of me speaking.
I am fresh out of my graduate fellowship in DH at the Scholars’ Lab, co-teaching humanities programming with Wayne Graham at HILT. I mention that there is a job in the region I want to apply for but don’t feel qualified. He tells me that I absolutely am qualified. That job is at W&L.
I am a graduate fellow in the Scholars’ Lab. The staff ask us to volunteer for roles on a collaborative project. They ask, “What do you want to learn?” rather than “What do you think you are good at?”
I am crying on an overlook on Afton Mountain. It’s the very last day that I will be commuting back to Charlottesville from my postdoc at Washington and Lee University. I have loved my time there, but the drive has been eating away at me in ways I did not understand. I won’t have to do it any longer.
I am a graduate student at UVA. I ask if I can use a laptop in the Scholars’ Lab. One of the staff responds with a laugh: “Of course - we’re not fascists.” I just came from an English department lecture in which they were banned.
I am crying in my weekly trumpet lesson. My teacher Paul Neebe gives me two pieces of advice. All bad sound can become good sound. The mistake I am making is thinking I will stay the same if I work at improving something.
I am a fourth grader trying to learn how to type. Our instructor teaches us about home row and how to use it to guide our fingers across the keyboard. It never sticks, and to this day I still use a whacky self-taught version of typing that usually involves me elevating my right pinky for no other reason than habit.
I am a second grader sitting off to the side of our classroom for mandatory computer time. My task for the afternoon is to practice clicking and dragging an icon across the desktop of the classroom computer. This feels easy for me, who used to play educational games on my dad’s work laptop whenever he would let me. I hurry through it to go back to playing games.
I am a freshman at UVA. We are on break during a weekly two-hour seminar that the instructor fills with incessant lectures. I am on my back staring at the stars beginning to emerge in the evening sky. There has to be a better way to learn. I decide I want to teach.
I am an undergraduate who thinks they can handle a 9:00 AM class fresh out of high school. I miss class constantly.

What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. So I will tag the posts accordingly to make them easy to connect. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email at bmw9t@virginia.edu.
===
“What is digital humanities?”
I was on my way to the annual meeting of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute when the customs officer posed the question to me. DH is a baggy and specialized academic field that suffers from as many competing definitions as it does detractors.  I have been asked to define the field more times than I count, but, standing in the immigration line at the Canadian border, I suddenly felt renewed urgency to get my terms straight. To describe my work with precision and clarity for a general audience. The officer ostensibly asked for an explanation, a narrative of my being in this place at this time, but he really just wanted facts. My actual response was unimportant. They just wanted to determine that I had a plausible reason for attending a conference they already knew was taking place (it was a small port of immigration and a large conference). There was a right and a wrong to the exchange. He wanted me to prove that I knew the proper response.
There was a pedagogy to the conversation, even though the officer might never have framed it as such. In Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire speaks at length of the banking model of education, the sense that typical educational practice sees students as operating at a deficit. The instructor, with their surplus of knowledge, deposits this valuable commodity in their pupils who are asked, in turn, to regurgitate learned facts at a later date. Power exists in the hands of the teacher, whose position of authority structures the economics of the classroom. Even though teaching and learning were far from the arm of the state I encountered at the Canadian border, a similar system of policies, power, and relationships structured our exchange. I was asked to participate in a quiz without being properly coached in the material, but the expected response was clear. “Show me you have the appropriate knowledge to show you are not a threat. Show that you have learned what it means to be a docile traveler,” the officer seemed to say, “and I will let you pass.” Freire’s central metaphor for this kind of encounter was economic: deposits, withdrawals, deficits, and surplus. But my encounter with customs showed that the same pedagogical apparatus operates in many walks of life. In this moment, I felt the pressure to teach this person something about digital humanities. To teach, in the face of an administrative official whose response to that instruction carried real stakes. To teach, while being confronted with an architecture that appeared to force my work to justify itself before knowing anything about it. Teach well, and I could continue to the conference. Teach poorly, and I would be subject to unknown bureaucratic hurdles. I only got so far as “Digital Humanities is…” before the official stamped my passport and let me through.
My encounter with Freire while traveling haunted me even once I returned to the University of Virginia and faced a different kind of border. It was the cusp of a new semester and the end of summer, so I took a few days to scout out the room I would be teaching in for the upcoming term. The space I found was a relic of an older era, before smart boards, inclusive design, or dynamic classrooms. With horror I found rows of old, wooden desks fastened to the ground with a series of bolts that prevented them from moving. The chairs produced an almost visceral response for students: they were physically uncomfortable, designed for normative bodies, and unyielding to whatever adjustments the user might need for their own work. I too had once sat in these very chairs during my undergraduate days at the same institution, and I remembered well the discomfort they caused. With an almost inexorable effect, the sense of being trapped led students to vandalize the chairs, and each chair was scrawled with the ink, carvings, and etchings of graffiti from decades of students. The chaotic, jubilant writings on each desk felt like an explicit act of rebellion against the physical space of the room and the desks themselves. Where the chairs spoke of quiet restraint, their surfaces told a different story, narrating favorite bands, quotations, weekend adventures, and more. Freedom. Flexibility. Movement. Waiting to get out of the chair.
A fresh-faced graduate instructor, I viewed these rows of desks from a perspective that was new to me: the front of the room. They might make sense for one kind of classroom, but I was puzzled as to how I would fit them to my needs for literary discussion. After all, they enforced a specific relationship between teacher and student by means of what Jesse Stommel has referred to as the “rhetoric of the room”—“the ways the shape of the room affects the learning we do inside of it.” The bolted chairs demanded the instructor take center stage, whether they wished to or not. While I had observed teachers carry out group work in those spaces, the physically restricted desks required students to turn sideways in their chairs in order to see one another. The room quite literally fought back against the pedagogy of the teacher and tried to enforce its own. Lecture; not discussion. Hierarchy; not democracy. As if aware of the tense dynamic between the instructor and the spaces given to them for teaching and learning, the students found themselves drawn back to carving their own frustrations into the furniture itself.
Still pondering these desks, I made my way over to the Scholars’ Lab, a center for digital research in the University Library where I had recently begun the first in a series of digital humanities fellowships that would lead to my present-day position as digital library professional. As was often the case, I plugged away on a group project with my fellowship cohort while sharing space with the librarians who taught us. I remember well the kinds of staff conversations we would overhear as we worked: endlessly supportive student mentoring, careful guidance in digital humanities project design, and the best instruction I had ever observed in my time as an educator. After one such meeting, as I expressed my frustrations with my role as a graduate instructor, one of these mentors floored me with their response: “I imagine that would be frustrating, but I don’t really teach.” This librarian was one of the best mentors I had ever had, and I regularly saw them shaping not just student research projects, but also providing expert guidance in how to shape a life doing this work.
How could someone so engaged in the act of teaching be so convinced that their work did not count? What was teaching, if not this? And who gets to make such determinations?
The immigration officer. The bolted desk. The university. They each regulate bodies, attitudes, and relationships. They share a crucial connection to my coworker in denial about their own teacherly identity. Our institutions carve out pedagogical relationships using spaces, policies, and actions while at the same time often rendering these dynamics invisible. As Stommel’s rhetoric of the room shows, spaces exert unexpected wills of their own, often over and above those of their inhabitants. But we can take his formulation one step further. The Canadian officer was acting in accordance with a long series of governmental policies enforcing social and legal procedures at the border. And rooms do not exist in isolation. The campus buildings at UVA contained many such rooms with bolted desks. Each of these roles and rooms was designed. Even though the UVA architect might not have thought of themselves as a teacher, their decisions actively shaped the experiences and pedagogies of those who do. Institutions of higher education are comprised of thousands of small decisions like these, innumerable small acts of pedagogy that affect teachers and learners—who we are allowed to be and who counts themselves as part of our number.

I’m in the middle of listening to an audiobook of David Byrne’s How Music Works. The book is a fascinating glimpse into the music industry, but I almost had to pull my car over when he started talking about digital humanities centers.
Okay–Byrne was actually in the middle of a whole chapter describing the special character of CBGB, the renowned music club that opened in 1973 and that was the frequent haunt of punk and new wave bands. But I was struck by just how resonant so much of his advice for cultivating a special and identifiable community was to me, someone who spends a lot of time working to do the same with students new to digital humanities. Once I parked, I quickly made some notes riffing on Byrne’s own eight characteristics of a successful music scene. I’ll share Byrne’s elements below and then riff on them as they relate to our own practice of cultivating collective DH experiences. You can find out more about Byrne’s own points by reading David A. Zimmerman’s summarizing blog post about the text.

There must be a venue that is of appropriate size and location in which to present material.
    
Space matters. It’s challenging to develop a sense of DH community without a space to gather, a place to house the energies of the group. One of the first tasks of a DH scene is often figuring out where it takes place. If physical space is not available to you—such locations are typically contested and hard won—take stock of other options. Virtual space, social media, community by mail, and more might be viable options, and they each offer their own affordances and limitations. And then make those spaces available to your people—as a student, it was impossible for me to reserve space. So friendly librarians who helped me do so meant the world to me.


The artists should be allowed to play their own material.
    
It’s not enough for community members to be passive contributors to the projects of others. They must be given the space and resources to allow their own creativity and their own original research projects to flourish. This also means making space for intentional play as a pathway to finding projects. Don’t ask people to show their DH project credentials at the door in order to get in!


Performing musicians must get in for free on their off nights (and maybe get free beer too)
    
Belonging should come cheap and often for those who want to join. In the Scholars’ Lab, we try to offer free tea and coffee to folks as often as possible. This might seem flippant, but it actually contributes in large ways to a sense of buy in with our group. Besides offering a ritual of belonging—we make this together for you—free coffee also offers a pathway into the Lab for those with economic hardship. Such resources are scarce for different communities, but it’s worth taking stock of what you can offer cheaply. What levers do you have?


There must be a sense of alienation from the prevailing music scene
    
For a DH scene to matter to someone, it has to stand for something. And that something typically stands in opposition to the larger institution around it. Look to your group’s larger context—what is left out? Who? How can your specific scene make space for those absences, center them, and give them a home? Discuss these values intentionally and find ways to act on them.


Rent must be low – and it must stay low
    
For Byrne, this was a larger commentary on the challenges of low-rent housing in a gentrifying area of New York City. For our own purposes, keep in mind that this work costs, but it should not cost the community. To keep your scene sustainable, it is worth regularly revisiting your prior assumptions about what is necessary to keep it flourishing. What might need to be sacrificed to maintain the ideological cohesion of your group? How does the changing financial landscape of your institution affect the underlying budgetary structures that make your work possible?


Bands must be paid fairly
    
Those who cultivate a DH scene have a responsibility to provide equitable compensation for the labor that its community members take on. Pay a living wage when possible. Advocate for better wages when it is not. Recognize and support labor organizing activities in the broader institution as you are able. Healthy labor practices ensure that your community knows you stand for and with them. They will notice.


Social transparency must be encouraged
    
Your community members make up your scene as much as the administrators who work in private to make it possible. Allow outside voices to help shape your practices—that’s how they become insiders. To cultivate the kind of DH scene your people want to see you need to ask them what they want. Ask what you can do for them—actions, events, speakers, and the like mean more when they come from community interest.


It must be possible to ignore the band when necessary
    
A flexible scene allows many smaller groups and communities to flourish. That is to say, a DH scene accommodates more than one use at one time. This is not to say smaller initiatives need be neglected. On the contrary—it allows your community to be agile, to flexibly act in many directions at once. Walk and chew gum at the same time. There are limitations to a group’s energies, of course, so be mindful of when you can ignore one aspect so as to safeguard energies for where you are needed.



I found, in particular, Byrne’s commentary on the intersections between spaces, policies, and creativity to be illuminating. Obviously there is much more to be said, and the analogy to Byrne’s music scene is not a 1:1 comparison. All communities have  limitations, and we cannot be all things to all people. But hopefully these quick notes riffing on Byrne are helpful as we all work to cultivate a sense of belonging and community in our own DH spaces. As you try to find your own scene.
Let’s jam.

I was always very quiet in coursework as a student. I have always had some measure of social anxiety, and I felt it especially acutely when pressured to participate in the service of a grade. This was a constant in every course I took except one: in graduate school I took a course with David Vander Meulen on textual editing, and I felt more engaged and free to do so than ever before or after. While David was an exceptional teacher, there were other specific reasons I credit with the vibe in the room: it was a three hour seminar and there were only four students in the room. I could not hide and, perhaps most importantly, in a group that small there was a real sense that we were in it together, that we were accountable to each other for keeping the conversation alive. The social anxiety persisted after the course, but I’ve always remembered that group dynamic fondly.
Did I mention the course met Friday mornings at 8:00AM? We really depended on each other to stay awake.
We’re trying a new thing this year in the Praxis program to bring something of this same spirit into the room, to encourage the students to feel more direct accountability for each other in discussion. In the past, whenever we’ve run unmoderated discussions I’ve generally facilitated them myself or in the company of a couple other Scholars’ Lab staff. Even when the students present their individual research projects for a design jam, a staff member serves as primary respondent and facilitator. This generally works fine, and the students are usually up for it. But the result is that the students are most accountable to the staff. This year I am going to experiment with rotating this role through the room a bit more, to spread the accountability around a bit more intentionally. For each session that will have discussion, I’ve assigned one or two students as primary facilitators. For sessions where a student will present, I’ve assigned another student as a respondent.
I’m trying not to overthink this too much: the real goal of this is to encourage collaboration, co-teaching, and collective buy-in in ways that might not take place if the students only feel accountable to the staff. But Jeremy wisely noted that not everyone might know how to facilitate a discussion. I come from the English department, where I’m used to teaching and learning based around open-ended conversation. But not every discipline is structured that way. Jeremy suggested I make a few notes about how I approach running discussions. What follows is my own starter pack for running a conversation. I have our own students in mind as the primary audience, but I imagine there is something useful here for others as well.

Questions not answers. This one comes from my literary studies background. I tend to see my role as a discussion facilitator as primarily about opening rather than closing, about shaping doors and inviting the group through. They can choose to enter or not, as distinct from other approaches to teaching that might pull the group along in a specific direction. When I write lesson plans they are almost always lists of questions to ask. Note that this is different from a project meeting, which has a specific goal and purpose! More on that in a different post.
Other shapes. I am not the sole giver of knowledge in the room. Instead of an arrow that I carve into the ground, what other shapes can the group draw together? How can we design our own ways of building knowledge together? Everyone has something to contribute, and I am there to learn as much as everyone else. The experience is not unidirectional. It twists, turns, folds back.
Give space. More than you think. I like to count silently to make room for others. When in doubt, sit quietly. Thinking is hard work, and hard work takes time. Don’t mistake silence for confusion or lack of engagement. Your silence can be a gift.
Be mindful. Who has spoken a lot? Who has not? How can you enlist the aid of the sturdy talkers in making room for others? How can you draw in the quiet ones? Pay attention to where you’re going as well as where you’ve been. Don’t think of yourself as yanking the group towards an end goal. Can you point the way and then follow? Can you help draw connections among various things that have already been said? At the end, can you sum up where you’ve gone together? I often like to drawn on the board to visually represent the flow of our conversation.

It should be clear from all this that my approach is as much about community building as an end in itself as it is about the actual material. That is to say—I like my students and my discussions to live out a specific kind of learning experience together using the material as a vehicle. We discuss the material too-quite deeply-but the particular manner in which we do so is as important to the learning goals as any particular message about the specific topic of conversation. When Jeremy asked me to write this post I immediately wanted to turn the question back around. How does he run a discussion, coming from history? How does Ronda’s own background as a life coach and project manager change her angle of approach? Everyone brings their own selves to running the classroom, and I think there is beauty in this diverse range of teacherly identities. I would love to hear how others take on this role and how they approach the difficult task of developing group identity, making space for other voices, and building up a collective teaching experience.

The following contains my lightly edited contribution to the ADHO2024 session entitled “Missions Accomplished? The Future of Mission-Driven Digital Scholarship Journals in DH.” The panel had representatives from several different digital humanities journals talking about ideological underpinnings for their publications.

Hello! My name is Brandon Walsh, and I’m the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab in the University of Virginia Library.

It’s wonderful to be with you today to talk about the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, a publication based out of CUNY that I have had the pleasure of working on for several years now. We are “A journal promoting open scholarly discourse around critical and creative uses of technology in teaching, learning, and research.”

My initial pitch for this group was to talk about the journal as doing more than just writing about teaching and learning: we also build pedagogy into our publishing process and infrastructure. But as I was researching for this talk I actually found that some of my colleagues on the journal’s editorial collective have already made that argument, so I wanted to first and foremost point you to their publication entitled “Who Guards the Gates? Feminist Methods of Scholarly Publishing” by Laura Wildemann Kane, Amanda Licastro, and Danica Savonick. They do a better job of articulating what I was hoping to discuss than I could, and I’d encourage you to go there first. In my brief time here I’ll just give the cliffs notes version of their work and try to build upon it. Laura, Amanda, and Danica discuss JITP in the following terms—as  model for feminist modes of collaboration and inclusivity:

Publishing timeline - the journal publishes twice a year, usually alternating a general issue with a themed issue. This extraordinarily rapid timeline has students and early-career scholars on the job market in mind - those in need of a publication on their CV don’t have the luxury of waiting years for more traditional venues. 
EC student quota - the journal has written into its governance structure that the collective be between 21 and 25 active members and roughly half of those members should be students. The journal’s managing editor is also a student whose full-time gig with the journal offers him membership in CUNY’s union.
Variety of publication genres- in addition to the twice-a-year issues that share long-form essays, we publish, on a rolling basis, a variety of “short forms” that expand the kinds of work we share: assignments, teaching fails, blueprints, and book reviews. This makes it possible for students to find a range of ways to represent their work professionally.
The article has lots more in it—lots of great data, history, and argument about the journal and what it means for students on the EC. It’s a space to learn about all parts of the publishing process, from editorial skills to technical web publishing literacies to inclusive and equitable publication practices.

All of this means that the infrastructure of the journal has teaching and professional development in its bones. We’re not just publishing the work of teaching: we’re baking it into the dough. Our plumbing is pedagogy. We’re not just a venue: we’re a means by which the professional development of young scholars is the core activity of the journal, where members of a scholarly unit can grow. In this way, I see our work as a natural evolution of what Matthew Gold, Katharine Harris, Rebecca Frost Davis, and Jenterey Sayers  have called for under the #citepedagogy movement, which is the idea that we need to cite teaching materials and syllabi as scholarly work in their own right to make them part of the scholarly record. In short, teaching is not the thing that distracts from research output. It’s a part of it. But JITP shows that our publishing infrastructure itself can be built and rebuilt with students at the core. In short, it’s not enough to publish pedagogy. We can work towards pedagogical publication, a publishing infrastructure that cares about the needs of students and early career folks first and foremost.

Again, please check out Laura, Amanda, and Danica’s work on this. In preparing for this talk, Amanda Licastro and I actually realized we were both presenting on related topics. Amanda will be doing a follow-up presentation at MLA this year about JITP and professional development so stay tuned for that one. We recently zoomed to discuss the overlap between this talk and her upcoming one, so I want to further give her credit for my thinking on this—I’ll mention her a lot in what’s to come and I think she’s here. I want to focus on one thing in particular—the makeup of the board.

To reiterate: the editorial collective is mandated to have a certain number of student voices on it. Every time we put a call out we specify that a certain number of those selected will be students. This is fantastic - it makes it so much easier to address feelings of imposterdom with students that I’m trying to recruit because I can say “no you are exactly qualified in so many ways. We are looking for people just like you!” It means that student experience, opinion, and vision is always centered on the collective. But there are also other ways in which this makeup causes significant challenges. The thing about students is they will eventually, one way or another, no longer be students. If all goes well they will graduate and move on to better things. This sort of turnover is a sustainability problem faced by all projects and all journals—but it’s especially salient for us because even if people stay they no longer count as students. The journal’s greatest triumph is if we provide a vehicle for professional development such that our students no longer count as such. This means that a healthy editorial collective oriented in this way will constantly refresh itself with new ideas and new persons on the board. It also means, of course, that there is a constant churn—always new folks to mentor, new visions to weigh. But this is the only way to continue to keep student needs in mind. What it even means to be a student is constantly changing. Students are not the same now as they were before COVID, as they were a decade ago when I was a student. Two decades ago. Three. Every year my own memory of what it meant to be a student living paycheck to paycheck recedes into the rearview mirror and it also, either way, bears only a tenuous relationship to current student experience. We need actual student representation in order to maintain that point of view.

To ground a publishing process in student needs and experiences might be an attempt to castles made of sand, to found our publishing practices on ideological and ethical grounds that must change, by design. I’m put in mind of Jesse Mitchell’s description of inclusive design as like bathing—you’ve gotta keep doing it. Orienting a publishing process around teaching, pedagogy, professional development is an ongoing, never ending challenge. A living wage today might be untenable tomorrow. What counts as meaningful professional development for one student might not parse for another. In this way, the instability that our student focus brings is perhaps a strength. You’ve got to keep bathing. If you want to do good, equitable and ethical student-centered work you have to keep re-evaluating your priors and how you think things need to be done.
Something I’ve been thinking a lot about: what do older hands bring to publishing pipelines that model themselves on newer voices? In a journal centered around the changing needs of students, what is the role of the non-student editor? What are our responsibilities? For one, we bring memory. The ability of the institution to remember its own history is always challenged by the fact that those with the memories are likely to move on. Amanda likened it, astutely, to the efforts by Cheryl Ball and Douglas Eyman to chronicle the history of Kairos. Simply remembering is labor in its own right. I wonder how much pedagogy publishing is itself an attempt to solidify and preserve the ephemeral acts in the classroom.
 There is also, of course, a certain amount of social and administrative capital that the more experienced editorial publisher can offer. A lot of what Amanda and I see our work on the collective as is to signal boost - to use our network to promote and extend the reach of the journal in a way that a graduate student might struggle with. Those networks just take time to build. I also try, at virtually every event I attend, to plug the journal and offer to people the opportunity to talk about our publishing process, how to submit, and offer feedback they might have potential article ideas. I extend this to you here and now as well! It’s a way to try to pay forward the good luck and mentoring that I have received.
In addition, Amanda works on the governance and oversight committee and had wonderful thoughts on her own relationship to that work. I love that our journal models itself on asking students to act in public as professionals and contributors to the scholarly conversation. But that process is not always smooth. It can be asking a lot for students, with little to no job security, to shoulder the weight of tense moments of internal or external conflict. It can be the responsibility of more established scholars to help shape a space for radical professional development and mentoring by doing but in a way that helps to mitigate the risks of acting as professionals in public in this way.
To put a button on these things—JITP is a model, I think, for how to build a publishing process that, in form and function, centers student pedagogy. It’s not enough to publish pedagogy or to cite it. Our scholarly structures need to be built and rebuilt with student voices, experiences, and needs in mind. This process is challenging, tenuous, and always in process. For those of us lucky enough to still be here, to be in full-time positions, it’s on us to help the students of today meet the challenges of this work. To help make space for students. To hold the bucket and shovel and dig in. Thanks!

Applications are now open for Praxis Fellowships to be held during the 2025-2026 academic year. Further details below about this application cycle, which has applications due November 1st, 2024. Consider spending time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2025-2026 cohort - Monday, September 9th, 2024 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities, offered by the UVa Library’s Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students each year as they explore various aspects of digital humanities together. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, and share a range of digital humanities activities over the course of the year. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to equip fellows with the skills necessary for future research, teaching, and administration within digital humanities.
Praxis training takes a variety of shapes meant to reflect the full-range of DH work.  As a part of their training with us, student cohorts regularly publish a range of values statements describing the intentional communities they want to build together. They also design and teach digital humanities workshops based on their own interests as a means to exercise minimalist pedagogical approaches to DH. Students design speculative projects and events that might go on to be implemented by the Lab. They also participate in a range of technical and design activities meant to reflect the range of digital practices they will encounter in their research. At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named projects. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the portfolio requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities and supplements the curricular work undertaken in that program.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. 
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we can certainly accommodate travel needs).
Students will often be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held, as the fellowship typically serves as a teaching replacement in the amount of $12,607 over the course of the year. Students rising into the fifth year of their support package who would ordinarily not have teaching obligations will be able to defer two semesters of teaching relief such that they will not have teaching requirements in their sixth year. They have the alternate option of leaving the structure of their current support package intact and instead receiving the fellowship as an external award up to 130% of their typical PhD fellowship amount as per GSAS policy. Students outside of GSAS or with other concerns should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility given their particular cirumstances.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from a committee about your application. To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiousity can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Monday, 12/2 from 10-12; or Tuesday, 12/3 from 1-3 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview);
Anything else we should know? - pronouns, a name you go by other than the one on your email, any other experiences or backgrounds you want to make sure we are aware of, or anything else you would like to share.

In addition, we ask for a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that the application can affect teaching rosters).
The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program. We recommend applicants start by reading our charter and a blog post on “Questions to ask When Applying.”
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due November 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

One of my earliest teaching memories was of too much. I had gotten an example syllabus to consult as I prepared to teach my own course for the first time, and I remember being floored by so many policies, most of them required by my institution. Did my first learning encounter with the students have to be structured exclusively by rules? By so many pages of them? How was I supposed to find my way as a teacher–just one person–among so much?
By contrast, less has paid dividends so often in my teaching career. Fewer readings, more conversation. Less technology, more time to develop literacy. Smaller scale, closer attention to the students in front of me. For me, thinking small always leads to impact–and a more sustainable classroom. Danica Savonick has a wonderful summary of her particular take on minimalist digital humanities pedagogy over on JITP. For her, minimalist DH pedagogy is a set of “strategies for teaching DH at institutions that don’t have many resources for doing so” by favoring free or low-cost tools. We could bring together a cluster of related ideas to extend this conversation. Paul Fyfe on digital pedagogy unplugged or Jentery Sayers on low-tech approaches to digital research as a way to center the underlying conversations behind the technology. Fyfe again on mid-sized digital pedagogy as a way to think about teaching through the continuum of what scale can be. John E. Russell and Merinda Kaye Hensley on buttonology as a way of thinking about teaching that over-emphasizes interfaces at the expense of critical thinking. For me, a minimalist approach to teaching digital humanities can be thought of as a generalized approach to the work that we do, a pursuit of the best possible teaching by creatively working at, across, and despite resource limitations. The pursuit of less is often the pursuit of reality, an attempt to match my teaching to my own lived experiences as well as to that of my students. A way of seeking safety for us to grow together. A healthy jog instead of a sprint. In most cases, this pursuit of healthy scale can feel impossible given the day-to-day circumstances of working in higher education.
More on the merits of minimalism in a future post though. For now, I want to write a bit about a related problem that I’ve been pondering as I try to theorize about minimalist DH teaching. What are these approaches writing against? How much of this is explicit and how much might be unexamined in DH teaching? How might more illuminate what we mean when we intentionally aim for less?
How would we characterize a maximalist approach to digital humanities pedagogy?
Marília Matoso has a succint summary of maximalism as a design aesthetic on ArchDaily. Maximalism is an approach that favors more. Organized excess, divergent patterns, and conflicting personalities: “it celebrates imprecision, embraces diversity, blurs the lines between reality and fantasy, encourages spontaneity, and champions freedom of expression.” Maximalism is a lot, and that’s by design. Here’s a photo from unsplash user Steph Wilson tagged as maximalist.

I’ve been able to find only very few people writing about maximalism in the context of education (if you have other sources let me know!). Paul Emerich France theorizes maximalism in the classroom in negative terms as an approach that stuffs more in wherever possible–more activities, more topics, more attention–in a way that is unsustainable. Richard Paul uses the terms differently: minimalist approaches to teaching focus on the educational environment itself–what do you need to learn to pass a test–while maximalist pedagogy is concerned with the transfer of academic lessons to the broader world. By Paul’s own admission, though, maximalist goals are something of an ideal to aspire to, as instructors are limited by the infrastructure they possess to support their work: “It’s not fair to expect a center to accomplish maximalist ends with a minimalist budget” (126).
My knee-jerk theorization of a maximalist approach to DH teaching is a starkly negative one: I’ve seen too much pain from unsustainable approaches to teaching and practicing DH. Resource scarcity is, I would wager, far more the rule than the exception in education. Whether it is the time-pressed and overworked instructor at a teaching-intensive institution, the under-resourced and over-tired K-12 educator, or the over-stretched digital humanities campus coordinator–rarely do we have enough, let alone space for more. Teachers in these contexts find themselves tossed between kinds of teaching–what they are required to do and what they would aspire to do–doing their best to survive while more is always in the offing.
I need to do more thinking, and I’ll doubtless put a caveat on this post in the future as I do so. But as of right now, my take might be summed up as this: maximalist digital humanities pedagogy is an approach to DH teaching and learning that aims for more as a virtue in itself. To be clear: I believe this approach is often unexamined, as someone new to teaching DH might default to this approach out of insecurity: “in order for a course to feel DH enough, students must do X, Y, and Z.” Teachers in this position don’t necessarily intend to adopt this pedagogical approach. After all, teaching towards less takes discipline. Rest requires restraint.
Put more bluntly, maximalist digital humanities pedagogy often operates without consideration of the costs, limits, or wisdom of scale. More often, I would wager, teachers are forced into this pedagogical position by forces outside their control. We might say, then, that institutions, administrators, or collaborators who ask more of their teaching staff are operating with a maximalist approach to pedagogy whether they realize it or not. As a result, the instructors–already in a position of scarcity–are forced to maximize as they are caught between these forces and their students. So, we might update our definition to say that a maximalist digital humanities pedagogy might be a function of circumstance, an institutional context, as much as a teacherly approach. We would do less if we could, but the operational pedagogy of the institution around us is towards more.
As I keep working on the topic I’ll want to think more about how to nuance this theory. In particular, my readings on design maximalism brought out many positive characteristics: joy, abundance, diverse points of view, democracy, acceptance, and more. How might we square these with our working definition of maximalist digital humanities pedagogy, one that must operate within the limits of our classrooms, our institutions, our lives? Can maximalist teaching be a good thing?
I could keep going. But, after all, this is meant to be a blog post in the direction of a future longer piece–not the longer project itself. Let me take this as a chance to do less. For now, I will close with a series of provocations that, to me, ring of a maximalist digital humanities pedagogy as I currently understand it. Think of these in the spirit of the Cult of Done Manifesto. The following messy, impartial list is meant to elicit reflection and pause. Think of it as a list of things that, when I see them, make me raise an eyebrow and wonder if maximalism DH pedagogy has snuck into the room. They make me wonder if we shouldn’t take a pause.
A Maximalist Digital Humanities Pedagogy is characterized by…

Many tools; few decisions
Dwelling only in possibilities
No constraints
More readings
Many project partners

Many assignments
The greatest
Breathlessness
Tech, tech, tech

This recalls Lisa Rhody’s fantastic piece on improv comedy and digital humanities, which points to the phrase as the foundation of generous collaboration. I wholeheartedly agree, but I need to think further in order to reconcile this with my own thinking above. Perhaps, one should ask “should we?” before we yes, and? ↩

My family moved house this winter, so I spent countless hours packing, unpacking, setting up, and driving. Audiobooks were a great companion for all that work. Here are the four relevant to DH and teaching that I got through in the past several weeks.

Ratchetdemic: Reimagining Academic Success by Christopher Emdin. I adored this text that was recommended to me by Seanna Viechweg, one of our brilliant Praxis students this year. In it, Emdin advocates for bringing the authentic, lived experience of teachers and students into the classroom, especially when their identities depart from what might be considered academically acceptable. Emdin writes explicitly from his experiences teaching in urban classrooms, where he saw the conflict between teacherly norms that value whiteness and devalue disruptive, lived, or “ratchet” behaviors. The ratchetdemic bridges these divides by making the ratchet a tool of political and pedagogical protest.
Fugitive Pedagogy: Carter G. Woodson and the Art of Black Teaching by Jarvis R. Givens. I went straight from Ratchetdemic to Fugitive Pedagogy, in part because some of the reviews for Emdin’s work put his work in dialogue with Woodson. Fugitive Pedagogy is both a history of Woodson’s innovative leadership in Black education as well as the articulation of a concept that Givens sees as central to that work. Fugitive pedagogy as a pedagogical theory refers to the ways in which Black education has always seen teaching and learning as acts of rebellion, from literacy as a path to freedom for emancipated peoples to the careful ways in which Black teachers navigated the hostile pressure from white administrators while attempting to teach in the Jim Crow era.
Feed by M.T. Anderson. I’ve long been kicking around the idea of an introductory literature course on the novel in the age of the Internet. Feed was recommended to me by my wife, who did her dissertation on Victorian teen culture and knows more about young-adult fiction than I will ever forget. Feed is a dystopian text where a majority of American citizens have an internet feed implanted in their brains that gives a steady stream of chat, marketing, and statistical data. My spouse and I talked a lot about how much different this text must have read in 2002, when it came out, as opposed to the present day.
The Professor is In: The Essential Guide to Turning Your PhD into a Job by Karen Kelsky. I’ve been familiar with Kelsky’s work for some time, more by reputation than for any specifics. In a recent conversation about professional development, a student referenced The Professor is In in such a way that made me feel I couldn’t avoid reading it any longer. The book outlines an extremely detailed path through the academic job market, in all of its toxic, challenging, and unfair shapes. While I might disagree with some of the specific recommendations, the overall message of the book–that advisors have an ethical obligation to prepare students for what comes after the PhD–is an important one. And I think it’s vital reading for anyone in a position to advise students, if for no other reason to be literate in the conversation.

As part of the final unit in the Praxis curriculum each fall our students extensively discuss teaching and learning in digital humanities. As a way of putting these conversations into practice, they develop two outcomes: a speculative, minimal DH workshop related to their research and a teaching philosophy statement related to their newfound interests in digital pedagogy. It’s been years since I’ve put together a formal teaching statement (unless you count the various student charters on the Scholars’ Lab website), so I had planned on joining the students in their writing process and producing a statement of my own to share with them. Things got away from me, though, as my wife and I just moved and are also preparing for our first baby. I didn’t have the mental wherewithal to devote to this task, but I thought I’d spin up something quickly in the same spirit.
I’m sharing this post as a creative spin on the genre: my teaching statement in thirteen images (thirteen because that’s the Praxis cohort we’re currently running). Consider it a visual collage of how I approach working with students in and out of the classroom. I used unsplash, a great source for open and free images, to search for keywords that were meaningful to my digital pedagogy. I won’t explain them beyond describing the pictures in alt-text. Instead, I think they’re useful to meditate on for yourself. When you teach, what do you see?

I’m going to start documenting the reading I’m doing on the blog here for a couple reasons. First, it will motivate me to keep at it! Second, it will give me some quick summary notes to look back on. I’m doing most of my reading these days by way of audiobooks, so it feels especially important to find some way of keeping what I’ve been exploring in my head. Hopefully this little public journal will do the trick! Here are some things I’ve been checking out lately, all available as audiobooks.


The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff. There are a range of useful terms here: instrumentarian, big other, shadow text, behavioral surplus, and more. They all cricle around the titular term, which refer to the new economic systems pioneered by technology companies that profit on the use of private data, data which enables those companies to further target consumers more precisely and efficiently in a kind of feedback loop.


Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code by Ruha Benjamin. This is an essential text for anyone interested broadly in how race intersects with technology. The “New Jim Code” is a useful takeaway term, and Wikipedia has good summary definition: “In it, Benjamin develops her concept of the “New Jim Code,” which references Michelle Alexander’s work The New Jim Crow, to analyze how seemingly ‘neutral’ algorithms and applications can replicate or worsen racial bias.”


Geeky Pedagogy: A Guide for Intellectuals, Introverts, and Nerds Who Want to Be Effective Teachers by Jessamyn Neuhaus. The main takeaway I got from this text was that sometimes new teachers assume that their passion for their subject matter will make them effective in the classroom. But this enthusiasm is not enough. Instead, Neuhaus offers a range of reflections to help new teachers from a broad range of categories–Intellectuals, Introverts, Nerds, Geeks–more effectively and inclusively reach a range of student audiences.


Write No Matter What: Advice for Academics by Joli Jensen. This book contains a range of strategies and tactics for fitting writing into the cracks of the academic day. While I disagree with the way the book treats labor within academic structures–really no matter what?–I did find some helpful approaches to developing process-oriented methods for getting writing done.


That’s all for now! More next time.

If you’ve spent any time at all reading on my blog you’ve probably noticed that I crosspost virtually all my material to the Scholars’ Lab site. There are good reasons for this: almost everything I do in one space is relevant to the other, and it’s way to drive traffic between the two places. It’s a bit of a pain though. While both sites are built with Jekyll, they live in two different repositories, two different folders on my computer. They also each have slightly different frontmatter. So my old workflow looked something like this:

Compose and edit in my blog repository.
Open a second window.
Carefully copy and past everything from my original post into the identical post in the other site folder.
Edit the front matter.
Publish.
Grumble the whole time.

I use a rake task to automate the building of the initial post, which saves a little time by generating everything for my post templates.
That command looks like this:
desc "Begin a new post in #{posts_dir}"
task :new_post, :title do |t, args|
  if args.title
    title = args.title
  end
  clean_title = title.downcase.gsub(/\s/,'-')
  title_slug =clean_title.downcase.gsub(' ', '-').gsub(/[^\w-]/, '')
  filename = "#{posts_dir}/#{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}-#{clean_title}.#{new_post_ext}"
  if File.exist?(filename)
    abort("rake aborted!") if ask("#{filename} already exists. Do you want to overwrite?", ['y', 'n']) == 'n'
  end
  puts "Creating new post: #{filename}"
  open(filename, 'w') do |post|
    post.puts "---"
    post.puts "layout: post"
    post.puts "title: \"#{title.gsub(/&/,'&amp;')}\""
    post.puts "date: #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}"
    post.puts "
tags: [digital-humanities]"
    post.puts "crosspost:
  - title: #{crosspost_title}
    url: #{crosspost_url}#{title_slug}"
    post.puts "---"
  end
end

A lot of the core code here was adapted from Octopress, a blogging framework I haven’t used per se in several years. There are some useful rake tasks that have persisted as my blog changed though. There’s a lot of Ruby above, but the upshot is that, when I go to blog, I give a command in this form from the terminal:

$ rake new_post["Flashy title here"]

The rake task will create a new post in my _drafts folder with 2023-10-23-flashy-title-here.md that looks like this:
---
layout: post
title: "Flashy title here"
date: 2023-10-23tags: [digital-humanities]
crosspost:
  - title: the Scholars' Lab blog
    url: https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/flasy-title-here
---


I’ll then fill in the content of the post below the triple dashes. After years of manually crossposting things, I decided to make another rake task that would mirror this one, a terminal command that I could run from my blog folder like so:

$ rake crosspost['2023-10-23-flashy-title-here.md','True']

This command would copy my completed post file to the other project folder for the Scholars’ Lab site, spin up the necessary metadata, and copy over any images that are necessary for the post.
Here’s what that rake command looks like:
desc "Makes a crossposted file in the slab folder"
task :crosspost, [:file_name, :images] do |t, args|
  if args.file_name
    file_name = args.file_name
  end
  puts file_name
  old_file = "_posts/#{file_name}"
  new_file = "#{slab_dir}/#{file_name}"
  puts new_file

  parsed = FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse_file(old_file, loader: FrontMatterParser::Loader::Yaml.new(allowlist_classes: [Date]))

  title_slug = parsed.front_matter['title'].downcase.gsub(' ', '-').gsub(/[^\w-]/, '')
  if File.exists?(new_file)
    File.delete(new_file)
  end
  File.open(new_file, 'w'){|f|
f.puts("---
author: brandon-walsh
date: #{parsed.front_matter['date']}
layout: post
slug: #{title_slug}
title: #{parsed.front_matter['title']}
category:
crosspost:
  - title: #{blog_title}
    url: #{blog_url}/#{title_slug}
---
#{parsed.content}
")
}
    puts "Crossposted file created at #{new_file}"
  post_image_folder = blog_image_dir + '/' + title_slug
  crosspost_image_folder = slab_image_dir  + '/' + title_slug
if args.images
  if File.exists?(crosspost_image_folder)
    FileUtils.rm_rf(crosspost_image_folder)
    Dir.mkdir(crosspost_image_folder) 
  end
  FileUtils.cp_r(post_image_folder + '/.', crosspost_image_folder)
end
end

This lets me pass the name of the post file and whether or not it contains images to a new crosspost rake task, which will then handle everything else for me. Now my workflow is much more streamlined. If you’re interested in setting this for on your crossposting needs, you can follow these steps.
Assumptions:

File structure
    
You have two jekyll blogging folders on your computer.
Each of these blogging folders has a regularized system for image handling, where you store the images for your post in project-folder/assets/sluggified-name-of-post
I’ve included at the top of the Rakefile a series of variables that you can update for the particulars of your file structure


Each blog post has the crossposting code as a part of _layouts/post.html
You will update the Rakefile to account for your own metadata, as well as any differences between metadata in the two blogs.

To implement on your own, then, do the following:

Create a Rakefile in the root of your main jekyll blog folder.
Paste into it the contents of this Rakefile
You’ll need to install one gem - front_matter_parser - by running this command from your main blogging folder: $ gem install front_matter_parser
In each Jekyll blog folder, add the following code to your post layout to actually use the crossposting metadata. Both folders have this in their _layouts/post.html file:

{% if page.crosspost %}
<div class="post_crosspost">
    {% if page.crosspost.size == 1 %}
    Crossposted to <a href="{{ page.crosspost[0].url }}">{{ page.crosspost[0].title }}</a>.
    {% else %}
  {% capture crosspostings %}
  {% for target in page.crosspost %}
  <a href="{{ target.url }}">{{ target.title }}</a>,
  {% endfor %}
  {% endcapture %}
  {% assign crosspostarray = crosspostings | strip | split: "," %}
  Crossposted to {{ crosspostarray | array_to_sentence_string }}.
  {% endif %}
  <br><br>
</div>
{% endif %}

Now you should be able to do something like the following as your workflow.

Make my new post: $ rake new_post["Title of Blog post"]
Draft and finalize post
Crosspost it by passing a filename and True if there are images to crosspost: $ rake crosspost["year-month-day-sluggified-title.md","True"]

Hope that helps! I tried to abstract things so that this could be usable by others with slightly different setups than mine, but let me know if you try to use it and run into problems.

Applications are now open for the 2024-2025 Digital Humanities Fellowship cohort. The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2024-2025 academic year is February 15th, 2024. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2024-2025 cohort - Monday, January 15th, 2024 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, encouraged to write for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can begin your application.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,480 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,480 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with the Lab and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The student’s Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student’s application.
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue (no more than two pages);
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that holding the fellowship can affect teaching rosters);
and your availability for a 30-minute interview slot during the following times: Monday, February 26 from 2:00-3:30 or Wednesday, February 28th from 10:00-11:30. This should be communicated in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise.

We’re in the thick of our unit on teaching and learning in Praxis, where students discuss a range of teaching topics including buttonology, minimalist pedagogy, and critical digital pedagogy. As outcomes for the conversation we ask the students to produce two things:

a minimalist, speculative digital humanities workshop on a topic of interest to them as a teach-to-learn activity
a teaching statement that might intersect with their new thinking on digital pedagogy

The context for the two assignments is that all DH involves teaching at some level. Graduate students rarely receive adequate training in teaching, and they often teach under very specific departmental constraints. The two activities are meant to give them experience thinking about a range of teaching possibilities that they might not otherwise get to experience. I would wager further that most departments don’t offer much training in writing about teaching, either in formalized teaching statements or otherwise. Ashley Hosbach-Wallman, UVA’s Education and Social Research Librarian, gives our students a wonderful introduction to writing about teaching. I pair Ashley’s workshop with a free-writing activity to help the students move past fears they might have about writing correctly on the topic. The only way to begin is by beginning, after all.1 I couldn’t actually be there in person to run this activity for the students, so I’m sharing these slides and the context for them in the hopes that they will run it at home.
Free Writing About Pedagogy
The spirit of this activity is heavily inspired by a workshop that Sean Michael Morris ran at Digital Pedagogy Lab on writing about teaching. All the good here comes from Sean - I merely adapted it for my own particular context. The gist is that the activity gives students a topic, a set amount of time to free write on it, and some rules to guide the process. The rules Sean gave for that writing process are mostly about self-criticism:

Don’t judge what you write.
Feel free to use first person.
Keep writing.
Be honest. Don’t write for someone else.

Keep writing, and don’t let your own internal voice get in the way of putting words down on the page. With those guidelines in mind, students move through a set of curated topics you give them. As facilitator, my job is mostly to encourage them to use the whole time saying things like “if you think you’re done keep going because you’ll go somewhere unexpected.” Mostly I just watch the timer. The activity is quite flexible and can be adapted to any circumstance: just change the prompts. In my experience, graduate students find it quite transformative and request the workshop a second time later in the year. The first time I ran it one of the students exclaimed, “I wrote 2000 words in an hour! My dissertation feels like it will be no problem!” For students accustomed to working towards perfection, free writing offers a radical reorientation towards what the writing process can feel like.
I start the workshop with a slide of my cat on a piece of paper just because I can. I usually offer some point of entry to the effect of…Pepper loves boxes. But they can also be scary? And what can make you feel more boxed in than a blank sheet of paper? Here is Pepper surrounded by frightening sheets. Free writing can help us get past the fear of the page and just put words down. But this has also just been an excuse to share photos of my beloved cat.

Moving on to the first free writing exercise. At this point in the curriculum, our students have done a mind mapping exercise that encourages them to free associate different linked concepts related to teaching and learning. I haven’t written up that actvity just yet (I will!), but you can find the slide deck on the Praxis site if you wanted to run it on your own. To get started with our free writing:
What are the most important values that you bring to teaching? To digital pedagogy? Write for eight minutes on this.

When designing your speculative DH workshop, how might you craft it in such a way that it reflects the values you just wrote about? How will you teach digital methods in a way that honors the things you care about? Write for eight minutes.

What activity are you planning for your workshop? What are the actual nuts and bolts of what you might do in the room? If you’re struggling to come up with an idea for the workshop, how might you explain the concept you’re interested in to a third grader? Write for eight minutes.

What sorts of anxieties do you have about teaching and learning? What fears do you have about digital pedagogy? What sort of things can you do to mitigate those concerns? Eight minutes again.

I usually close the workshop with another photo of Pepper. Now, having written, he is happily asleep and at peace. He’s moved past the box.

And that’s it! The activity is very flexible–add topics or take them away. Add time or subtract depending on the amount of time you have. Run the activities for yourself or others. If this approach to writing feels completely anathema to the way you work, you might find yourself pushed in new directions. If this all feels familiar, maybe the slides will help give you more material for what you’re already doing. I’m really grateful to Sean for the workshop that got me going in this direction. His workshop on writing about teaching really taught me a lot about both.



Ashley’s workshop also incorporates free writing as well! She does a great job linking formal and informal ways of writing about teaching. ↩

Praxis is in the middle of our unit on digital humanities teaching and learning. As a part of this section of the year, our students’ task is to design a lightweight, speculative workshop that introduces a DH concept of interest to them. The activity is a teach-to-learn one with some constraints: in an effort to move beyond buttonology approaches to teaching technical topics, the students are meant to think through how pencil and paper, low-tech, or otherwise minimal ways of teaching might empower themselves and their students to learn material that might otherwise feel beyond them.
At this point in the semester the fellows have just begun their thinking. I asked them to run an activity related to Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities as a means of finding the areas within digital pedagogy that speak to them. And then from there we did some mind mapping work meant to encourage the students to think broadly about how teaching intersected with their interests in the field. So the fellows all have a general sense of what their workshop topic will be but no specifics just yet. Yesterday when discussing their ideas, a number of the students expressed difficulty moving from these large topics to actual, teachable activities. How do you get from a focus on network analysis to an activity using string and rope? Do you just wait for inspiration to strike?
I’ll be sharing a few posts in the coming weeks with exercises that our current fellows might use to help facilitate the brainstorming process. In this first piece, I’ll touch on ways to bring iterative design into the development of lesson plans to open them up as spaces of possibility. I’ll call it “One Concept: Ten Ways to Teach.”
One Concept: Ten Ways to Teach
I would wager when most people lesson plan that they try to do so as quickly as possible. Working under the constraints of limited time and resources, we probably take the first or second good idea that we have for approaching our material. Rarely do we dwell in the possibilities that the learning experience might contain, but a quick speculative exercise can help us do so when we have the luxury of more time to think. If we iteratively take on several different approaches with intentional constraints we can explore the myriad ways we might approach teaching a particular topic.
The title and approach here shamelessly adapt (rip off) Wired’s 5 Levels series. In the 5 Levels videos, an expert teaches a single concept to five different audiences and with varying levels of complexity: “first to a child, then a teenager, then an undergrad majoring in the same subject, a grad student and, finally, a colleague.” In the video I’m most familiar with, music phenom Jacob Collier explains the definition of harmony to a child (harmony makes a melody less lonely and helps us change how it feels) all the way to jazz legend Herbie Hancock (what even is harmony anyway?).
The series orients itself around a kind of idealistic approach to teaching and learning: a complex idea can explained to anyone given the right approach. While that is a useful lesson in itself, the approach can also be used as a generative exercise in iterative design. Forcing ourselves to explain the same concept with varying levels of complexity and constraints can help us push past our usual teaching models. Here’s how we might apply it to a DH context.
Take one minute to think of the DH topic or method you want to focus on. Write it down.
You’ll now practice different ways of teaching the same idea. For each one, take one to two minutes to think and then three minutes to write before moving on to the next one. In each case, it is probably more important to capture the general approach you would take than to focus on writing an actual, new explanation. For each new way, consider these questions:

How will you need to explain things differently?
How will the genre of the teaching change?
What will you (or they) likely have trouble with (can you ignore that thing entirely)?
What will you need? What can you let go of?

Here are the ways:

Teach the idea to an academic not in your field.
Teach the idea to a very well read, bookish friend who is not an academia.
Teach the idea to a child.
Teach the idea using something in your home as a prop.
Teach the idea using a metaphor.
Teach the idea using a lecture.
Teach the idea where you don’t speak and the students come to the realization on their own.
Teach the idea using no technology.
Teach the idea in the worst way.
Teach the idea in three words.

Etc. etc. You might come up with your own! The number of ways is arbitrary, but the important takeaway is simply that the ways are numerous. Success in the activity does not come from finding the one perfect approach. It comes from trying on new things. And then another. And another. When all is done, you might take a look at how your thinking has changed over the course of the exercise. What was especially challenging? What seems like it would be the most fun to teach? What will be your way?

The current formulation for Praxis has the students carrying out a small-scale hackathon in the spring as a way of practicing the various intersecting pieces of the curriculum they’ve learned throughout the year. The segment is meant to draw together lessons in project development, humanities programming, and critical approaches to design. We have a few moments in the year to scaffold the process leading to the hackathon and help the students come to a shared sense of their goals and activities for that time before the event itself. In describing how the process will work for the students, I proposed that we start with a working definition for digital projects. After all, groups always struggle to define parameters for their work. Shared definitions and milestones can help make that process easier.

a digital project = a digital method applied to a particular object of study

And, for the purposes of the hackathon, we’re describing an object of study as a contextualized set of materials that serves as a point of intervention for a broader range of interests. Given this, we have a few components to sort out before we start: the group’s shared interests, an object of study that reflects them, and a digital method to apply to that object. Given these three components, we’ve set a few conversations throughout the year to develop them together.


In October the group will meet to define their shared set of interests. The staff will provide context for hackathons as a genre and help to poke these interests in directions that feel feasible. This is how the pre-work for the session is described on the curriculum:
  “Get together as a group to find a broad shared topic/interest that will be the subject of the hackathon. Not thinking objects of study or materials at this point - those will come later. Just subjects/topics. We’ll discuss and help narrow as a group.”


In late November the group proposes a few objects of study with that reflect those interests (thinking datasets, collections of materials, etc.). The staff will workshop these with the students to find materials that feel workable within the timeframe. This is how we described the pre-work on the curriculum:
 “Given your shared interests, come to the session with some sense of what your object of study will be to explore them during the hackathon. What will your materials be? They have to live on the web somewhere. Could come with 1-3 things as options and we help narrow. You will come out of the session with the data source that you’ll then play around with over the winter in preparation for first steps in the spring.”


In January, the group proposes 2-3 particular digital methods to explore that object of study. Again, the staff help push and shape in the direction of what feels possible. This will give us some time to supplement our general humanities programming instruction with a few sessions geared to their specific interests. The curriculum again:
 “Given your proposed objects of study, come up with 2-3 approaches to them that interest you. We will try to get them to narrow to some methodological constraints, but we’ll try to keep this data or Python oriented. This will allow Shane to structure the CodeLab instruction a little more.”


And, finally, the hackathon takes place over the course of four weeks in April. In making it that long, we’re stretching the typical bounds of the genre. But the longer period allows us to jettison some of the toxic working conditions of the format and hopefully find a happier balance between marathon and sprint.


Of course, this definition of DH projects is limiting–other contexts might define them differently. I don’t think every digital project needs a method associated with it, for example, so I’m not sure I would even subscribe to this particular working definition in most of my work. Think of this formulation as an enabling fiction with the goal of drawing out certain kinds of DH work–we’ll discuss others at different points throughout the year. Hopefully, though, the hackathon process helps students new to project design, DH collaboration, and hackathons get some orientation to the process.

Praxis is wrapping up its unit on community building within digital humanities. The opening segment of the year is meant to welcome the students into the lab, get them thinking about how this space might be different than what they’re used to, and illustrate how alternative spaces like these enable different kinds of work to take place. This section of the year has the following activating questions:

What constitutes a community in DH? how will we design one together? how do DHers articulate these practices in public? how do you publish on DH community? how do you find your way into these communities as individuals just starting out?

And this cohort specifically engaged in the following questions:

Who are we? who are we not? who is in the room? who is not? what assumptions does the room make? what is the nature of our community? how will we build and maintain and generous and equitable environment? what are our hopes and dreams? our daily practices? how do I intersect with the group as an individual? how does the group intersect with the world outside? how do I? how are communities formed and reformed? how can we create a community mindful of our own biases and the systems of power in which we swim?

The cohort explored these topics by writing a group charter (a statement of values that they want to put into practice together) and designing plans for self-study based on various presentations from the lab community. The goal is for them to examine how the various communities within the lab and the field more generally intersect and how they might find their own particular way of intervening.
We’re about to move on to a new unit on teaching and learning, but I wanted to offer a few words on how things all fit together. We cover a variety of topics throughout the year:

Communities
Teaching and learning
Research infrastructure
Practice (under which I’m broadly including our technical curriculum)

Of course, it’s impossible to separate any one of these segments from the others. We might visualize their interconnectedness like this (pardon my handwriting).

So, as we shift out of focusing on community and towards the other units this year I wanted to offer a few questions one might ask to help activate community considerations in the other forthcoming topics.


Teaching and learning
What assumptions do our pedagogies make about who is in the room? how do our physical learning spaces include or exclude? what are small community-building practices we can implement each day to create the collective we want? how might we draft community agreements like charters with our students? do our syllabi fulfill the same purpose? if not, why is that? what are the thousand small acts of teaching and learning that we engage in everyday, and how do those invite or push away students and collaborators?


Research infrastructure
Take any given solo-authored research activity–what is the large, unstated community of collaborators behind that work? how might we most generously credit all those involved in digital projects? how does the institutional position of digital work affect its nature and who is allowed to participate in it? what audience do we imagine for our work? how might any given research activity cultivate a specific community that will live beyond it? what kinds of values documents–MOUs, charters, etc.–can we offer to help intentionally shape our research practices?


Practice
How do the technical choices we make reinforce or undercut systemic power imbalances? how can we make our technical practice as inclusive as possible? what daily practices might we implement to turn solitary activities into collective ones (paired programming, code review, etc.)? how do our past histories with digital methods inform, strengthen, or frustrate our efforts to put them into practice today? how are those past histories shaped by politics, systemic power imbalances, identity, and more? how can we pay forward our successes to others and learn from our failures?


All parts of our work are informed by the communities at the center–or periphery–of them. And that community-building is not a one-off activity–it is the result of hundreds of small practices. Questions like these can help us to center and intentionally cultivate group identity and the audiences for our work.
Much more to say, but I’ll leave it there since each of these topics will get their own post later on.

I posted this summer about how I’ve been doing more DH listening–podcasts, lectures, workshop recordings–as a way of keeping up with the field in the cracks of the day. In that post I started a running list of things I’ve been checking out, and I just added a few DH-relevant audiobooks to that post as their own section. While they’re not as easy to come by free, you can still find a fair number of DH-y audiobooks included as part of subscriptions to other services or provided by your local library.
I’ve just finished three audiobooks and started a fourth:

Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy by Siva Vaidhyanathan
Mindfulness for Teachers: Simple Skills for Peace and Productivity in the Classroom by Patricia A. Jennings
Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy by Tressie McMillan Cottom
Play Anything: The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games by Ian Bogost

All very doable in this format, and all related in some way to the work that I do.
Interestingly, even though each of these texts comes from a very different domain, they all share a common concern with systems and the ways individuals engage with them. Vaidhyanathan writes at great length about the ways Facebook sets up dialogic structures that are antithetical to democratic practices of deliberation and debate. McMillan Cottom’s work concerns the ways in which the conditions of credential creep in the labor market create an environment ripe for exploitation by for-profit colleges and leave students paying the price. Jennings describes mindfulness practices as a means for refocusing classroom practices towards attention, wellbeing, and emotional work, both a pedagogical and individual response to difficult professional circumstances. And Bogost’s book asks us to consider the creative navigation of systems of limitations–and the pleasure it affords–as something we can direct to all parts of life.
I’ve been enjoying this new phase of my listening a lot. Historically I never really got to read long-form texts unless I had a specific research reason for them. I was much more likely to read blogs or articles to keep up with the field. But I have found myself much more likely to take in large works as audio in bits and pieces.
Consider this a plea to the world for more academic audiobooks.

I used to blog regularly, but that publishing schedule happened roughly whenever I felt like it. During the pandemic I experienced a series of personal and professional challenges that caused me to slow things down considerably across the board. The result was that my writing schedule ceased–I simply did not have the energy to blog on top of other things. This past summer I set a goal for myself to post once per week as a means of trying to force myself back into a blogging mindset.
I managed to stick to that rough schedule, partially due to a concentrated sprint early in the summer that gave me a backlog of posts I could use downstream. Now, at the end, I am surprised to find that things cohere more than expected. As a means of putting a button on the experience, I’ll close with this post, meant to conclude the sprint but also to serve as a persistent introduction to the collection of work. In what follows I’ll introduce the collection, reflect on the process a little bit, and reorganize the various posts into a set of thematic groupings. Consider this a table of contents, introduction, and conclusion all at once.
Publishing weekly was, of course, too much. Anyone could have told me this. I even would have advised myself against it. I usually tell my students to aim for regular posts to blogs or social media on a sustainable basis, a steady trickle rather than an intermittent flood. But the crunch of this writing push was quite intentional. I’m a very process-oriented person, relying on regular daily practices as opposed to big sprints on things. I live my work life out in Pomodoros. I wrote most of my dissertation at 5:00 AM in 750-word-a-day chunks (using an online system that rewarded me with kitten photos with each milestone). This probably goes back to an old adage I heard learning music growing up: it’s better to practice every day for an hour than for seven hours once a week. My hope was that a weekly posting schedule would force me into a daily writing practice of some shape. This worked to a degree, though of course with the needs of daily life such a schedule is unsustainable. I settled into a regular practice of returning to writing in a few inconsistent and intermittent sessions per week. Perhaps most importantly, I started to divide those sessions between writing, proofing, prepping, and publishing in ways that worked well for me. I’m an endless tinkerer, and it’s easier for me to hold myself back if I know I’m not supposed to be adding new content when I sit down.
Another side effect of the sprint was that I found myself writing different kinds of things than had been my habit in recent years. I wanted to use the summer to push myself towards different scales in part to prove to myself that not everything needs to be a big Statement™. This experiment was largely successful–I found myself posting on tool tips, resources I was putting together, one-off teaching exercises, and generally just documenting a lot of approaches I take to conversations 1:1 with students. New topics also brought new lengths. I was pleased to see an estimated reading time of one minute on one post. I have always loved this about blogging–that the genre is what you make of it–but it was a lesson I had started to forget over the years. I also found myself more likely to bring in my other interests–music most often–that might otherwise get left out of DH pieces. In short, the need to publish pulled me along the path to innovation. I used to write blog posts one at a time, but I developed a habit this summer of having several posts in various stages of publication at once. Some of my writing time was spent just brainstorming a list of topics and titles for future posts, which I found useful for providing a well I could return to periodically for new ideas. This process was very different from my old approach to developing new posts, where I waited to feel like I had a complete statement before writing.
Multiple people across platforms commented on my ongoing writing with some version of “I’m enjoying this series!” Comments like that were, of course, appreciated. But they were also a little surprising. Was this a series? The conversations got me thinking about the point at which a collection coheres, when parts become a whole. I’ve had the goal of blogging my way towards a book proposal for a while, and some of the things I wrote about were in that direction. But, in other ways, the posts I wrote this summer felt like a pretty loosely associated set of topics only connected by my own interests. Does it matter if your writing coheres across pieces? Does it do so simply by virtue of occurring in the same space in a compressed span of time? Is a snapshot of writing at a particular point in time useful on its own? I took a step back and was surprised at the degree to which they do actually cohere, particularly when reorganized thematically rather than chronologically.
I’m certainly not the only one still blogging, but it’s common to hear that the field has mostly moved on from the practice, at least in the way in which the early 2010’s saw not just a network of DH blogs but also consistent engagement happening in the comments. Given this context, why do some of us still blog? Counting this piece, this summer I wrote 15 posts totaling about 17,250 words. Through it all, I found that the pieces share a core set of interests. I’ve always felt that controlling my own publishing process was a way to control my own professional narrative, to write the work into existence the way I wanted, separately from an external academic publishing pipeline. And the core goal of my work in this space, now more than ever, remains sharing as a virtue in itself. I like to think of blogging, in its purest form, as a letter to myself in the past. What do I know now that I wish I had known five years ago? What practices might I want to share back? I covered a broad array of topics here: video game writing, music, teaching, technology. But there are no descriptions of domain-specific research in progress in my posts this summer. What you find, instead, are reflections on teaching and program administration in the hope others might benefit,  resources for professional development aimed towards students and early-career professionals, and more. Across the board, the aim has been to share things that might be useful to others. I found that they can be organized into four rough groupings: Meta-DH, Resources and Documentation, Professional Development, and Reflections on Writing.
I’ll be slowing down considerably after today–the weekly pace was never intended to be an ongoing thing, though I might return to it next summer given the rhythms of my work life. I’ll be hoping to find regular intervals that keep the writing alive that won’t burn me out. In the future I’m going to downgrade to probably biweekly posts at most, monthly posting more likely. I’ll be continuing to blog in the direction of larger and longer writing projects. And I’ll keep experimenting with scale and form. But this was an interesting experiment in sustained writing activity over a span of time. I’ll probably return to this format again in the future. If you’ve made it this far thanks for reading! If you’re finding your way to this little collection of work for the first time I hope there’s something in it that you will find useful.

For years and like many in DH, Twitter was my main connection to the larger DH community, both to share my own work and to see what was going on in the field. I never felt that I was consistently active on the platform, but I had accumulated a modest following over the course of the last decade more by virtue of consistency than anything else. I was always convinced most of those were bots, but I did come to cherish the little cohort of DH regulars that interacted in that space. It was how I learned about the field, found jobs for students, and generally stayed connected.
The platform has long been fraught, a wildly different experience depending on your identity and work. But things feel different now. This summer’s writing sprint coincided neatly with Twitter’s ongoing implosion due to Musk’s mismanagement (the platform became X since this post was first drafted). I’ve largely refrained from posting there for a few months as the ties between the app and far-right politics felt increasingly difficult to ignore. The platform’s continued decline has caused an identity crisis for a number of DH folks. Even for those that remain, it’s clear that the collection of DH users there is not what it once was. Where has our DH community gone since Twitter? How would I find them? Quinn Dombrowski has posted about their experiments building community on Mastodon, and I’ve been exploring that space slowly and haphazardly. My colleague Will Rourk has found some exciting success posting about his 3D scanning with his students on LinkedIn. Bluesky seems most promising to me, as a growing cluster of DH folks seems to be making their way there (more on Bluesky at the end of the post). I now am juggling half a dozen social media apps for work, where I used to have just one. Which of these platforms would work for me? Is it possible to just work in one?
The writing sprint gave me an opportunity to test my own network and try to answer some of these questions. In the before times, I would have tweeted each blog entry with a couple ICYMI posts to make sure I got coverage. I might occasionally post to Facebook. But I didn’t think more of it than that. The audience was on Twitter, and it was all I had. Now I had a range of apps to test. I signed up for TinyAnalytics, a free and privacy-conscious alternative to Google. Each time I posted, I shared the link using the same language to the same set of platforms:

the #community channel shared by the UVA Library and the Scholars’ Lab slack teams
Mastodon
Facebook
LinkedIn

There are all sorts of issues with this “study” of mine. I was fairly new to Mastodon when I started this series. I’ve been on Facebook for years, but my community there consists mostly of friends along with the occasional DH colleague. I’ve largely just had a placeholder LinkedIn profile. I could have added Instagram, but I tend to leave that exclusively for music content. And I only started using Bluesky towards the end of the summer. While there is nothing rigorous about the analytics work I’m doing here, I still found the results interesting.
Mastodon and Slack combined for 70% of the referrers to my site over the summer (my analytics lumps both under “direct links” and can’t differentiate between the two). I assume that figure mostly comes from Mastodon given the difference in engagement I noticed in each space. Even though the platform is newer and my community smaller, the people there seem more likely to engage than folks ever were on Twitter. Smaller audience, higher impact. Interestingly, it also seems to be largely a different audience, perhaps because I’m on the Humanities Commons server and not on anything specific to digital humanities. Not everyone from Twitter made the move over. I had expected it to feel like I was posting into a void, but I wound up with the sense that I could still get writing out there.
My old habit of sharing exclusively to Twitter made some assumptions about my audience that this experiment made clear. As folks spread to different platforms, I also found myself reaching communities that I never would have expected. I had a local artist come up to me at a recent music gig and talk to me about the blogging I had been doing - a first! Grad school friends who I never would have expected to take an interest in this particular work pinged me to talk about the writing. Our union organizer appreciated a post Ronda Grizzle and I co-wrote about facilitating meetings. I started to think of my work less as specific to a DH public audience and more as an overlapping set of publics with different interests and priorities.
Students regularly ask whether you need to be on Twitter to participate in digital humanities. My answer has always been complicated. Up until a year ago, I would have said you certainly don’t have to, but the platform, for all its risks, could connect you to communities you never would have imagined. At present, I would discourage anyone from joining it for the first time given its politics, mismanagement, and the fragmentation of the digital humanities community in that space. Instead, I would encourage folks to explore alternative platforms. For now, I’m bullish on a combination of Mastodon and Bluesky as a viable path forward. I’ve found that each of these two spaces has their uses. Bluesky, especially, has seen a growing number of DH folks join and participate in it in the weeks since I drafted this post (I am one of those latecomers!). You need an invite code to join, but there is a small handful of folks soliciting the community on a regular basis for codes to give to DH folks looking for access. Quinn Dombrowski and I put together a google form for soliciting invite codes and sharing them out if you have them. So far we’ve connected about 60 folks to the platform, so please join and engage! Quinn also noted that ACH is developing a working group aimed at reconnecting the DH community on the platform and building into a positive one for us. So watch that space for further developments. If you’re joining for the first time, check out Mark Sample’s DH feed and add yourself to it (currently has about 125 people in it). I’m hopeful Bluesky will continue to grow into a workable alternative, particularly in conjunction with Mastodon for a broader, less DH-focused reach.
I’ve always felt social media was what you made of it. If you never posted, your network would never grow. If you regularly engaged, you would find an audience for your work overtime. The platforms also offered clear diminishing returns at a certain point: harassment, mental health anguish, a time sink, and more. All the same, this summer has made it clear to me that I need start engaging intentionally again. The DH world is still figuring out where to land, but it’s clear to me after this summer’s experiment that social media can still be a viable way to reach an audience. Even though it feels like I’m starting over, I was pleasantly surprised at the engagement I’ve found this past summer. The process has reminded me of something I had forgotten: blogging feels worth it to me even if you get only a handful of engaged readers. You can still find those even in the fragmented social media ecosystem.

Applications are now open for Praxis Fellowships to be held during the 2024-2025 academic year. Further details below about this application cycle, which has applications due November 1st, 2023. Consider spending time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2024-2025 cohort - Monday, September 11th, 2023 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities, offered by the UVa Library’s Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students each year as they explore various aspects of digital humanities together. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, and share a range of digital humanities activities over the course of the year. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to equip fellows with the skills necessary for future research, teaching, and administration within digital humanities.
Praxis training takes a variety of shapes meant to reflect the full-range of DH work.  As a part of their training with us, student cohorts regularly publish a range of values statements describing the intentional communities they want to build together. They also design and teach digital humanities workshops based on their own interests as a means to exercise minimalist pedagogical approaches to DH. Students design speculative projects and events that might go on to be implemented by the Lab. They also participate in a range of technical and design activities meant to reflect the range of digital practices they will encounter in their research. At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named projects. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. 
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we can certainly accommodate travel needs).
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. Students outside of GSAS or whose teaching would already be relieved through other sources during the fellowship year should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility given their particular cirumstances.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from a committee about your application. To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiousity can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Monday, 11/27 from 11-12 or 2-3; or Wednesday, 11/29 from 10-11 or 2-3 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview);
Anything else we should know? - pronouns, a name you go by other than the one on your email, any other experiences or backgrounds you want to make sure we are aware of, or anything else you would like to share.

In addition, we ask for a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that the application can affect teaching rosters).
The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program. We recommend applicants start by reading our charter and a blog post on “Questions to ask When Applying.”
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due November 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

Michael Levenson, my dissertation director, always had great ice breakers. I most remember one that opened a graduate class on Henry James and Joseph Conrad: “What do you read for?” Separate from research questions per se, this was an invitation to think about what made a passage pop to us, what was at the core of our interest in particular topics. I remember saying that I often found myself writing about problems, puzzles at the core of passages that didn’t make sense. A friend noted how he was drawn to conflict and politics. Another cited interpersonal relations as the thing that drew them in. I marveled at how rarely I thought about the foundational interests in my research areas. What is it that makes one put down the book and pick up the pen?
For over two years now I’ve been writing for Backlog, “a video game newsletter for people who are behind on videogames.” Writing about a different subject for a public audience has been invigorating, not least because it forces me into new topics than I would otherwise have posted on in this space. Now that I’ve published to Backlog ten times (with an eleventh piece on the way), I thought I might take the opportunity to step back and apply Levenson’s exercise to my writing on video games. It’s easy enough to pick out the genres of games that I like: role playing, Soulsborne, and simulations to name a few. But, besides play, what drives my curiosity? What makes me put down the controller and text Backlog’s editor with an idea? In what follows I’ll take my list of publications, group them loosely based on topic, and offer a few quick observations.
Self-reflection
My essay on Sekiro and its connections to therapy was the piece that editor Grayson Morley first asked me to share to Backlog. That work also laid down one consistent throughline in my games writing. What do games teach us about ourselves? Returnal struck me for its dreamlike exploration of trauma and grief. And my experience of Skyrim was largely one in which I wanted to ignore the game’s chosen narrative and write my own, quieter story. Games that make you think about ourselves are often the ones that stick with me once the controller is laid to rest and the console cools down.

“Skyrim and a life ignoring destiny,” Backlog, February 16, 2023.
“Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and confronting yourself,” Backlog, December 29, 2021.
“Returnal and the unbroken loop,” Backlog, September 29, 2022.

Genre machines
Genre is often the first way many of us find games, and it structures so much of the gaming experience. I often find myself interested in those moments when genre is laid bare, when a game is so transparently generic that its core feels hollow or shattered into pieces.  Triangle Strategy struck me as genre in search of a narrative. I found my inspiration for a forthcoming piece on the free-to-play game Royal Match in its absurdly generic advertisements featuring celebrities who appeared to be forced to read the same script against their will. What’s left of a game when it’s all genre, all the way down?

“Royal Match and the Slow Death of the Soul,” forthcoming.
“Backlog draft about Triangle Strategy,” Backlog, November 3, 2022.

The weird
In the last moments of Subnautica, my scuba diving game forgot what water was. I spent hours trying to get out of a pit because my character was the only thing that had forgotten how to swim on a water planet. On Tiktok, players of The Sims chronicle their attempts populating their homes with hellish, glitchy monsters and murder victims. Games are strange. People make them stranger. When things get odd I get writing. Anyone who has played D&D with me will find this no surprise–I tend towards chaos and developing very bizarre characters.

“Subnautica and the glitchy terrors of the deep,” Backlog, July 28, 2022.
“SimsTok and the horrors of domesticity,” Backlog, February 3, 2022.

Playing together
I love co-writing and co-teaching, and it’s no accident that I’ve found myself in a career in which I can make space for both. Academic work always felt isolating, and the joys and tensions of working with other people are part of what drew me to digital humanities. I never really played sports growing up, so my earliest encounter with team dynamics was in cooperative gaming. Backlog has given space for a range of co-op opportunities, first with Morley and then with our colleague Alyssa Collins. One common thread through these conversations has been just how different play is for each of us. In Dredge, Morley dutifully followed the game’s narrative. Collins curled up with a coffee and was content to fish for fun. I zipped away into the sunset, made a pact with the devil, and promptly got eaten by a fish. Games are much more than the mechanics and aesthetics of the software. They exist at the intersection of player and platform, and we each construct our experience in service to–or in spite of–the game’s instructions. Backlog and Backchat (the accompanying podcast) have been fascinating reflections on how a single game can refract into profoundly different experiences for different people.

“Backchat: Dredge,” Backlog, with Alyssa Collins and Grayson Morley, April 22, 2023.
“Nobody Saves the World and exuberant middle schoolers,” Backlog, with Grayson Morley, March 16, 2023.
“Don’t Starve Together and friendship via chaos,” Backlog, with Grayson Morley, June 30, 2022.
“Backchat: Boyfriend Dungeon”, Backlog, with Alyssa Collins and Grayson Morley, June 22, 2023.

Most interesting and, perhaps, unsurprising is that all these intellectual interests are consistent with those I explored in my graduate research. Genre disruption, puzzle boxes, introspective strangeness, connection–those topics easily characterize all of my favorite twentieth-century works of fiction and the things that I read out of them in essays, articles, a dissertation, and more. I’m reminded of a quote from Ulysses - “Think you’re escaping and run into yourself.” When I put down my work for the day and start playing games to relax I can’t help but be intrigued by similar topics. Or maybe Popeye said it best - “I am what I am, and that’s all that I am.” Brandon all the way down, in work and play.

DH is teaching.
End of talk. Can you imagine? A whole talk that is less than five words long.

That’s about the point when my cat bit me to wake me up. He’s been getting me up egregiously early lately, and I jotted down some notes about the dream as I waited for him to finish eating so I could go back to sleep.1 I was giving a conference talk, and Jennifer Guiliano had introduced me by giving me a bag of onions.2 There were shades of the time when a classmate told our Joyce professor he would be submitting a copy of Ulysses for the final exam.
DH is teaching.
What more need be said?
I’ve often said the phrase around the Lab but never thought to write it down publicly. Perhaps I thought such a thing would make me sound too much like a true believer. Or that it was so obvious a statement as to render it meaningless. Or that I was not the first to say such a thing.3 The past several years have seen increasing work on digital humanities pedagogy,4 but this post is not merely a commentary on the importance of teaching as a practice to the field and its development. To say DH is teaching is, rather, to point to the baggy, messy nature of the field and what it means to talk about it to an audience.
Whenever I give a talk on digital humanities, I assume a range of listeners in the room. The wildly interdisciplinary nature of DH means someone is always going to be at sea with some aspect of the material. If I present on topic modeling, some people will know the methods deeply, some will be less familiar, and some will just be there for the disciplinary material I am analyzing and have no sense of what the term means. I have never felt comfortable presenting on digital methods as though everyone in the room is in the know. Instead, I almost always try to present as though someone in the room is learning things for the first time. The Scholars’ Lab has a related XKCD comic on the Ten Thousand pinned to our wall:

The comic assumes that acts of teaching are explicit and intentional moments of pedagogy, but I’ve always found digital humanities to be characterized, instead, by ten thousand small and quiet acts of teaching and learning. It’s such a baggy field – I’ve never felt able to assume there was a shared body of knowledge among the people in and around it. There is always someone on the periphery of the  big tent, always someone coming through the flaps for the first time. Think of the students and early-career scholars learning these methods for the first time. Or the digital humanist experienced in one area but attending a talk more outside their wheelhouse. It’s impossible for any one person to know everything. Any conversation about digital humanities necessarily is an act of teaching and learning for someone, whether the teacher recognizes it or not. Whether or not you’re in the classroom.
What are you teaching? To whom? What kind of student evals would you get?
The cat has finished, so that’s as good a sign as any to go back to sleep and see what other blog posts visit me in dreams.



Perhaps a sign that my subconscious would really like to stop posting once a week? ↩


What can I say–dreams are weird. ↩


Definitely ping me if you or someone else has done so! Would love to credit and have someone to cite about it. ↩

If you’ve followed me on social media for any length of time you likely know that I am a musician. I play horns with The Hard Modes, a group that performs original jazz arrangements of video game music. There’s some slight overlap between my time with that group and my work in the DH world, insofar as people in the DH community often tend to enjoy video game music (Quinn Dombrowski even had us perform for the Animal Crossing: New Digital Humanities series!). But the COVID-19 Pandemic and resultant social distancing the last few years really made the work feel more DH-y as we tried to find ways to keep playing together remotely even while it was unsafe to do so in person. We wound up releasing an album called The Lan Sessions that consisted of tracks where all the individual instruments were recorded separately and at home. Greg Weaver, our bandleader, arranger, and saxophonist, talks a bit about the process of facilitating those remote home recordings in his blog post introducing the project.
Working on those tracks taught me a lot about home recording, music production, and music technology. I found it all fascinating, especially the complicated chain of events necessary to make one of these art objects come to life. For the purposes of this post, I wanted to extract from that experience a generalized workflow for others interested in remote recording projects. Full credit here goes to Greg for his guidance in how to do this work - he helped me troubleshoot throughout, and I am mostly documenting the process he shared with me (for myself as much as for others). By necessity I will stay fairly high level: I won’t be noting which buttons to click in which program for the simple fact that each step along the way is fairly complex and dependent on what software and hardware you are using. You can write whole articles just on what microphone to use, whole books on how to use Finale. Instead, I’ll just aim to give a broad outline of the steps with some context for why they are necessary. I’ll try to connect readers to other resources for more information on how to work through each step. One last caveat: I’m sure there are other ways to do this work. This is just the one we used. The workflow I’ll describe will give you a rough roadmap for going from a planned arrangement to a finished recording.
Pt 1: The Setup


Complete the arrangement.
Perhaps obvious, but it helps to have some sense of what your arrangement will be before moving to prepare things for recording.1 E.g. we will play a melody over these chords followed by two solos and then end in X way. For this workflow you will want to have some sense of the arrangement and the parts before you sit down to start tinkering with next steps. Doing so will save you time, lest you lose work by changing things around too much later on.


Create sheet music for the score and parts.
The next step involves taking your arrangement from abstract idea and making it into concrete parts for your players to follow. The music notation software I use for this is Finale. Another option is Sibelius. These programs are deep. After years I feel I am only beginning to scratch the surface of how to use them.2 Finale lets you easily manage all parts of the sheet music process like quickly transposing to different keys, extracting a score to individual parts, hearing a synthesized version of what things will sound like, and more. At the end of this step in the workflow, your goal is to have a score and, most importantly, individual parts for all your musicians. You’ll have sheet music to pass out, but you’ll more importantly have the beginnings of a template arrangement.
Resource:

I like the tutorials shared on Finale’s own website for getting started with the software.



Export your arrangement as a MIDI file from Finale and import it into a Digital Audio Workstation.
Now that we’re done with sheet music, you will want to export your work to a different piece of software. To do so, you’ll export your arrangement in a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) format to convert your music into data that can be exchanged across programs. Once you export your work as MIDI with all the instruments save as individual tracks, you will create a new empty project in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and then import that same MIDI file.3 I use Logic, but other options are Pro Tools or Ableton. We’ll use the DAW for the remaining parts of the workflow.
Resources:

Exporting as Midi from Finale
Working with MIDI in Logic



Assemble each of your tracks and check them
After importing your project in your DAW, your next goal is to get a series of tracks for your project. You will want:

individual tracks for each MIDI instrument
a metronome track for the tempo

You might have other specific things you’ll want to add, like a four-measure count-in. Things are always a little wonky at this stage, so you will want to check the arrangement pretty closely by listening back to it. At first, every instrument will default to a piano track (this makes drum parts sound especially chaotic). So you will need to assign an appropriate instrument sound to each track to make the piece play back as expected. You also should check each instrument individually. I have found that bass parts, for example, sometimes transfer over an octave or two below where they actually should be and come out quite muddy until you adjust the register.
Resources:

Guide to multitrack MIDI recording in Logic



Modify the project’s structure to reflect the arrangement
Once you have everything in Logic and sounding alright, it’s time to tinker with the structure of your arrangement. Sheet music will sometimes expect certain parts to be looped and use notation as a shorthand for this process: pages and pages of repeated sections get shortened to just a page with a few symbols that a player knows to read. But you need your recording tracks to be very literal. Your goal is to make it so that you have a track that can be played start to finish and reflect the actual arrangement you want. Think of it as though you are working towards a blueprint for your group.
 Move things around in your DAW on a macro level to reflect exactly what you want it to sound like. For us, this usually entails taking the solo sections and copy/pasting them a few times so that they repeat as expected.
Resources:

Export the project and share with your group.
Now you have a mockup template for the group that you’re ready to share. You’ll want to export WAV files of each track, including the metronome track. You also might want to export the project as a MIDI track just in case. At this point, we usually share all these files in a Google drive folder and send an email to the group with instructions for recording, the order in which each person should record, and any other project-specific settings.
Resources:

Exporting individual tracks in Logic



Pt. 2: Recording
All of the above is just setup done by the person leading a particular arrangement. At this point, you should have a blueprint for your arrangement and a series of individual tracks for each instrument. The next phase involves each collaborator recording their own part, layering these live recordings together to make a final project.


Get the project
Each person should have access to your shared folder with the arrangement materials. Each collaborator imports the project tracks into their own DAW so that they have the same template to work from. Because we will start mixing live audio recordings with the individual MIDI instruments, the process of importing them will be slightly different. See the resources below for more information. At the end of this step, they should have individual tracks for each instrument as well as a metronome track.
Resources:

Importing audio tracks in Logic



Record their part
Each person should have the full project at this point, broken into individual instrument tracks. The recording process can look wildly different depending on individual setups. For example, each of us recorded with different microphone setups. The construction of your room will affect the sound, as will the distance to the microphone. In my opinion, your best bet is just to start with what you have, listen back, and research how to make adjustments in search of the sound you want. I fell down a real rabbit hole trying to get my trumpet to sound true to life before I learned that the disconnect between my room sound and the recorded track was expected (trumpet needs some reverb and EQ in order to sound “natural”). You can save yourself a lot of frustration by spending time researching tips for recording your particular instrument.
When ready to record, each person will mute the MIDI instrument corresponding to their particular instrument and record their own live part over it. When done, they will export only their recorded track and upload their live materials into a shared folder. If you are planning to use video, you will want your players to record it at the same time. We usually had a phone recording in landscape HD at the same time we recorded audio, clapping at the beginning of the take to make it easier to line up the separate audio and video recordings down the line.

Tips for getting started for home recording



Repeat
Each subsequent person repeats steps one and two. The collected multitrack recording builds up over time as each new person adds a new live instrument. With each new track, more of the instruments in the mix are live and not MIDI. You might consider tinkering with the order in which you have people record. Greg had us record the rhythm section first, followed by soloists, followed by a second pass of the rhythm section re-recording their parts with the live soloist. This essentially duplicated some of the same work, but it meant that there was perhaps a bit more of a live feel to the interplay between soloist and accompanists than there might otherwise have been.


Next steps
After everyone has recorded, you’re on your way! At this point, you might send the materials off to be engineered and mixed for consistency (or do so yourself). After all, everyone recorded their parts separately so there is likely to be some massaging needed to make a track that sounds consistent across the board. You might also be interested in cutting together a video to share online based on the work you did. This can be an intense process in its own way, but you have most of the raw materials you need for it. I’ll share some resources below for getting started in that direction. Working on these projects was a long, at times tedious process, but I’m very happy for the experience.

Notes



There can be broad variation in how the arranging process looks. You might plan things entirely on a piano. Or you might skip that step and compose entirely in a program meant for sheet music before sending to a different piece of software to prepare the recording process. Or you could arrange entirely in a Digital Audio Workstation and skip the initial process of making sheet music. For our purposes we used two different programs–one for sheet music and one for mixing–and had to export work between them. ↩


If you’ve never used music notation software before, you can gather their importance from a situation that happened to me in college. I had written parts for an entire band with pencil by hand. After I finished, I realized I had made some significant mistakes and had to rewrite whole sections again by hand. Too many eraser marks make things quite hard to read and take forever to clean up. ↩


In Logic at least, your project will likely ask if you want to import tempo information and ask you to select a frame rate for the project. These are both dependent on the particular project you are planning to do. ↩

I’ve long admired Lisa Rhody’s post on what digital humanists can learn from improv comedy. Besides the excellent message that text conveys on collaboration (always ask how your contribution moves things forward), I always think of that piece as a model for how outside interests can inform the work that we do. For my own part, a lot of how I approach collaboration and digital humanities comes from the world of music. I’ve played in a variety of bands and musical contexts for at least twenty-five years, and my experience as a part of the Charlottesville jazz community especially has long shaped how I work with others. Jazz history is full of lessons for the prospective DHer (or really for any field).1 I’ll focus today on what digital humanists can learn about collaboration and leadership from one the music’s most prominent bandleaders–Duke Ellington.
Ellington’s long career as a director, composer, and arranger for jazz big band is a masterclass in how parts become a whole. Billy Strayhorn described the focus on individuals as integral to Ellington’s compositional approach: “Ellington plays the piano, but his real instrument is his band. Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I like to call the ‘Ellington Effect.’”2 The Ellington effect refers to the distinctive musical heights that can be achieved when catering to the unique capabilities of the musicians in the ensemble as individuals. That is to say, the term also refers to the inseparable link between person and performance. Ellington did not compose for musicians in the abstract. He had specific performers in mind from his regular group. He knew their strengths and weaknesses, and he developed music for their particular voices. A good example of this can be heard in “Concerto for Cootie”, a tune that features trumpeter Cootie Williams moving through a variety of different styles, including his characteristic growling plunger mute. I’ve played that piece, and it can’t help but feel like you’re doing an impression of someone else when you perform it.
To abstract the term outwards and draw lessons for DH, we might replace music with any kind of labor. Approaching work with the Ellington effect keeps attention on the specific people in the room. So many problems occur when working in the abstract rather than with the specific collaborators you actually have. We run up against unrealistic expectations for projects that balloon out of control. We exasperate collaborators and ourselves by making plans that can never fully come to fruition. Or our students might be left out in the cold, lost and confused because we don’t keep in mind how their backgrounds, experiences, or training affect their learning. An approach to digital work informed by the Ellington effect keeps expectations aligned with reality by focusing back on the people at play. The following questions might help guide this person-oriented approach to DH in mind:

Who is in the room?
Who is not?
What can they do?
What can they not do?
What do you expect of them?
Do your expectations line up with those realities?
How can you reorient your expectations to meet reality?

We can go further though. After all, Ellington’s prowess was not just in getting people successfully through a piece of music. The Ellington effect referred specifically to his ability to direct the unique characteristics of individuals in the creation of art, where the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. This principle thinks about individuation as a superpower. Our teammates, supervisees, our students: these people have limits, but they also have possibilities. Careful work to cultivate their skills as individuals can be a means by which the project, the team, or the classroom grow in ways that exceed our own expectations. Collaboration might become art. Some further questions to dig deeper and aim higher:

What are our superpowers?
What about this work especially interests each of us?
What especially excites us outside of this work? How might that point towards unexpected expertise?
What are we capable of that no one else could do?
What different group arrangements do we have (pairs, triads), and how would each of those create a different, unique team?
What might our team name be?
What might our team song be?
How might all of this change the work to be done?

Intentional conversations about group and individual identity like these can lead research and teaching in new directions. That quiet student in the room with an outside interest in film might become easier to draw into conversation if you ask them to speak from that perspective when commenting on a text. That collaborator who has past experiences with life coaching will have a totally unique perspective to give on project design.
To my mind, there are obvious intersections between this approach to collaboration and care work. It’s long been a principle of the Scholars’ Lab to put people first over projects. Our student programs aim to teach the whole person. The Ellington effect in this context refers as much to cultivating individual strengths and caring for weaknesses as it does to the need to make considered space for the lives of those persons. To put a finer point on it, I could imagine someone reading this post and thinking, “Ah this isn’t for me. I’m a professional. This feels too personal. I don’t want to bring my own life into my work, let alone the lives of the people I work with.” Fair enough. This approach to collaboration does bring with it challenges. But I will close by noting that the line between the personal and the professional is often an illusion that reinforces systemic inequalities. Not everyone can so easily draw a boundary between the different parts of their lived experiences. The student grappling with food or housing insecurity cannot help but have it affect their work. The staff person on term-limited, contract employment cannot help but feel the weight of that precarious position intersect with their contributions to the team. The grieving coworker might not be able to work as much as normal. In this sense, I see the person-oriented approach embodied by the Ellington effect as a recognition of reality. The lives in the room might be difficult to reckon with but ignoring them will not make things easier. Intentionally engaging your collaborators as individuals can help to address challenges early, before they fester, and give space for everyone to sing.



There are plenty of negative examples too. Probably not a good idea to throw cymbals at your collaborators. ↩

Several years ago I wrote a blog post entitled “What is Praxis Working on?” The TL; DR of that post was that I regularly have people approach me (students included!) to ask what the current cohort of Praxis–our project-based introduction to digital humanities–is currently doing. Typically, that question is a shorthand for asking after the big, branded final project for the program. In that post, I argued that such questions miss the point: the digital projects our students take on have always been a means to an end to give the students space to practice, but the real projects are the students themselves. And we’re really working on being better for them.
Over the years, we’ve revised the program in a range of ways. We’ve become more systematic about the topics and workshops we offer, coalescing around a more intentional curriculum. Realizing that for all of our teacherly ambitions we did not discuss pedagogy very much in the program, we implemented a pedagogy unit where students pilot DH workshops of their own and document them for others. And a desire for more intentional project development took us down the path of collaborating with library and community stakeholders for the end-of-year projects. Part of this work involved compressing the end-of-year project to make room for these other topics and areas. What had been almost the entire year became two-thirds became one half.
Despite these changes, for the students everything seemed to build towards a singular experience that wound up feeling like the major takeaway and centerpiece of the year. I felt a consistent tension between the goals of the program as we articulated them–an emphasis on process and people over products–and the attempt to have students develop a digital project wholesale from scratch each year. The role of the project was to offer hands-on experiences for their own sake rather than as necessarily a research project in itself, but that was often a tough sell for students. After all, the academy rewards CV lines, and our praxis projects frequently received awards and publications. Of course the students wanted to aim for those possibilities. But no matter how we shaped this process, either giving the students full freedom to design their own final project or more directly handing them something to work on, there never seemed to be a path free of unproductive friction. I think student takeaways from the shared project varied wildly, in part because the cohorts were brought together by an application process rather than shared methodological, disciplinary, or topical interests. If you’re fundamentally uninterested in VR, for example, it can be tough to swallow working on a VR project intensely for a semester just for the good of learning. Some students are able to make that leap. For others that might feel a bridge too far when confronted with the pressure to build a thing by a deadline when they also have their own departmental projects to work on that are more directly relevant to their futures. To put a finer point on it: even as the student cohorts consistently viewed the final project as the real work of the program, the vast majority of our students would not go on to use those specific methods in the future. The real takeaways were everything else around that research project.
At the same time, I increasingly felt that the intense focus on hands-on technical training perhaps misrepresented the kinds of work that we do as digital humanists. Technical work is certainly a piece of the DH world, but the arc of the Praxis year sometimes felt as though, to the students, the experience didn’t start until they were building a thing. I recall a similar experience when I was a young student myself visiting conferences and elder DHers would, soon after meeting me, ask what my digital project was. I always stumbled. remember thinking “Do I have to have one? Is all DH projects? Am I not a DH person unless I have a research project?” The answer, of course, is that you don’t; it’s not; and you are. DH work is not all projects. Or rather - projects and scholarship take many different shapes, inflected by institutional makeup, job roles, local needs, etc.
Put another way: when we say methodological training in the digital humanities, we cannot reduce it to technical skills. So much of our day-to-day work in the lab extends beyond the building of things. Community building. Teaching. Learning. Talking. Thinking. Event planning. Project design and management. These are all measurable skills, and they’ve all been a part of the program since its beginning. Our staff and students regularly publish on them. We wanted the students to see the year as a portfolio of experiences that exercised all these muscles, but the real estate of the curriculum taken up by each of these components was uneven. In the rush to build a thing, we sometimes lost sight of why, for whom, and what was meant to be learned along the way. What was meant to be project-based pedagogy sometimes felt like it was project first and pedagogy second, if at all.
This intense focus on delivering a digital project through the program by the end of the semester often led to weeks and months of sprinting and left students and staff alike burnt out by the end of the year. Taking a hard look at what we were doing, what was working, and what was not was an attempt to honor our charter and “build up people and practices over products.” Is it worth producing a quality digital product at the end of the year at the cost of the hearts and minds of those involved? What are the actual limits of an interdisciplinary group of students to make meaningful interventions in a field that is new to them, that they have varying levels of investment in, and with methods that they are just learning? Might there be a better way that can retain the same lessons, make space for new ones, and lose some of the unproductive friction?
It’s no coincidence that these particular redesigns to the program emerged roughly at the same time as we all continued to reckon with ongoing crises in higher education, public health, and more. Part of our hope in reworking the year was to find the spaces to create the learning experiences we wanted in a more manageable and consistent way. It’s easier for students to see how DH will fit into their futures if they have space to look up and breath during the pace of the year. And staff need the space and flexibility to carry out teaching in a healthy way. Foundational to our pedagogy is the hope that we teach and learn in a way that makes space for life outside the Lab. The changes this year were an attempt to incorporate breath and pause into our program. To take an annual marathon-turned-sprint and convert it back to into a healthy jog. After all, the first marathoner died from the exertion. Not a healthy mentality to base a program around.
All of this is context for what has felt for some like a dramatic shift this year but, to me at least, feels like the logical step forward in a yearslong process of trying to find the best possible way to ground our activities in pedagogy and people first. The old structure I often felt left students too rushed to reflect on their work and the staff too busy to help make space for them to do so. The new arrangement aims to give students time to think through what they are doing and why, and it fosters dialogue with staff because everyone has more space to work. In practical terms, we’ve shifted further towards framing the year as a portfolio of experiences in a series of units, each with their own deliverables.

DH Communities
    
What is this space and how do I fit in? What values will we bring to it?
Deliverables:
        
a group statement of values
individual plan for DH learning for the year




DH Teaching and Learning
    
Now that you’ve found a way into the community, how do you articulate that space and its methods to others?
Deliverables:
        
individual pencil-and-paper DH workshops based on research interests
individual teaching statements informed by digital pedagogy
group workshopping of these materials
group participation in running these workshops




DH Research and Administration
    
How I step into a role of active participation in this community? How do I go about building it with others? And what is next for me?
Deliverables:
        
group speculative project design activities
group event planning exercises
individual research project proposals for what comes next
group workshopping of these materials





This portion of the year opens and closes with a pair of exercises grounded in the students’ individual research agenda. In the fall we design jam on each student’s interests as a way to show them the avenues their work might take in DH. In the spring each student proposes a project they might work on after Praxis, and the group gives feedback on how to make the thing a reality.
At the same time that we shifted things around and reduced the space taken up by the final project, we actually expanded the hands-on technical training for the year. We’ve offered a semester-long introduction to code for several years now as a part of the program that we call CodeLab. That curriculum now has a companion piece in DesignLab, a ten-week introduction to critical approaches to design for Digital Humanities work in a range of technologies. This technical track runs in parallel throughout the year as a lab and meets weekly in conjunction with our other general work. Then, in April, all other work for the program stops and the students engage in a short-term prototyping exercise, somewhere between a hackathon and a semester-long project. The students spent four weeks coming together to scope, design, and begin to implement a small draft of a draft together. This is what has become of the yearlong fellowship projects of past years. Our hope was that lowering the stakes while keeping some of the urgency might allow us a space in which students could still practice what they learned while not overselling expectations or ambitions. The goal is for the students to carry out some project design and methodological experimentation on a small scale as a means of bringing together what they’ve learned in the past year.
We still have some tinkering to do next year, but I’ve been pleased with how the students responded to the changes. My sense is that this group of students has the best sense of where DH will take them next and the technical experiences to get them there, even if this year did not result in a finalized product launched and released to the world. That is to say, the project-building portion of the year feels a bit more commensurate to the other pieces of the year and, to my eye, better reflects the different paths that one might take through DH. Praxis continues to reimagine graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age, even as our definition of that methodological training changes.  I’m very grateful to all of my colleagues for their help in making these changes possible in what I hope is a better and more sustainable program for all of us especially Amanda, Shane, Jeremy, Ronda, and Laura. This work is always a group effort by the Lab staff, and I’m immensely thankful to share community with you.

Blogging more this summer has unsurprisingly meant that I have spent a lot of time on my blog. I noticed that the way I had my site generate category pages had stopped working at some point. I set the whole thing up so long ago that troubleshooting it was hard. My old way involved using a plugin to generate categories, which meant that I needed to host my Jekyll site separately from GitHub Pages. Searching around for other options eventually took me to Long Qian’s post on generating tags in Jekyll, which promised to do a similar approach but with vanilla Jekyll and liquid syntax.
I got their approach working to replace my old system. My old use of categories was pretty restricted though–I had really only used them to create separate pages for my pedagogy, DH Now, and DH+Lib posts. But Quian’s post got me thinking about discovery and my blog archive, so I took things a step further and added just a couple tweaks to their post (based on a Stack Overflow post they linked). I got a little tag cloud visualization working - pretty simple, but I hadn’t thought such a thing was possible in vanilla Jekyll/liquid.

If you’re interested in getting it going on your own, you’ll follow all the steps in Qian’s post. But then the last tag cloud code will need to be modified slightly -

{% capture temptags %}
  {% for tag in site.tags %}
    {{ tag[1].size | plus: 10 }}#{{ tag[0] }}#{{ tag[1].size }}
  {% endfor %}
{% endcapture %}

{% assign sortedtemptags = temptags | split:' ' %}
{%- for temptag in sortedtemptags -%}
  {% assign tagitems = temptag | split: '#' %}
  {%- capture tagsize -%}{{ tagitems[0] }} {%- endcapture -%}
  {%- capture tagname -%}{{ tagitems[1] }}{%- endcapture -%}
  <a href="/tag/{{ tagname }}"><code class="highligher-rouge" style="font-size:{{ tagsize }}px;"><nobr>{{ tagname }}</nobr></code></a>
{% endfor %}

I modified the last couple lines to adapt the Stack Overflow response. You count the number of posts associated with each tag and use that to set the font-size for each link. And then I edited an earlier line to set a baseline font-size of 12px.

Students often ask me during professional development conversations to talk about my own path that brought me to where I am today. I thought I would document a version of that narrative here in the spirit of the “Origin Stories” shared as a part of the Speaking in Code event hosted by the Scholars’ Lab years ago. I found those narratives to be helpful as I was finding my own way, however contextual and idiosyncratic they might be. It’s hard to know where one might walk when the tracks aren’t always clear. Hopefully my own winding path will prove useful to someone else, even with all the caveats I note below about how dependent my own story is on circumstance, luck, and privilege. This post will be a little more detailed than the 1:1 conversations I have with students, and I’ll try to save reflections for the end.
I was a big tech nerd growing up. I played video games obsessively. As far back as I can remember, I told people that I planned on being a video game developer and was going to ride my bike to Seattle to enroll in Digipen. This cross-country bike ride never materialized, in part because in high school I took AP Computer Science and despised it. I did fine in the course, but I absolutely hated the process of writing code with pencil and paper.1 That learning experience turned me off from any potential career in the field. At the same time, fantastic teachers were encouraging my growing interests in music and literature. I wound up studying the latter subjects in college and leaving behind my childhood interests in programming.
When I started my PhD program in English at UVA I had never heard of digital humanities. Fresh out of a terminal MA degree at the same institution, I somehow missed all the DH work going on at UVA already. Even had I heard about it, I probably would have assumed it was not for me based on my past negative experiences learning C++. I was ultimately pulled into the orbit of DH and the Scholars’ Lab by a few historical coincidences:

I started my PhD in 2011
The Praxis Program also started in 2011
During its first year of the program, Praxis did not have a university-wide reputation just yet so the applicant pool was lopsided towards particular disciplines. The first cohort consisted of five students from English and one from Art History.
Because of point three, I knew a lot of people taking part in the Praxis program that first year.

I observed from the outside as my friends got a hands-on, rapid introduction to a range of DH methods and conversations. I saw their work on Prism, a tool for crowdsourcing textual interpretation. At the same time, I was just starting to develop my dissertation topic on sound recordings and literature. My initial interest in DH was based on this work in multimedia. I thought a dissertation on audio might be aided by technology, by thinking beyond the printed page. And the growing reputation of the Scholars’ Lab among my friends was that it was a space in which newcomers and experienced programmers alike could find a home. I thought I would give programming another shot.
I applied for the Praxis program the next year and didn’t make the cut. I was waitlisted, so I assumed that was that–DH wasn’t for me. Shortly thereafter I attended ThatCampVA and sheepishly avoided all the Scholars’ Lab staff based on lingering feelings of rejection. Months later and right before the next academic year I got a call from Eric Johnson to let me know that a student had withdrawn from the fellowship. I hopped off the waitlist and took part in the second Praxis cohort. The Praxis Program for me was a broad introduction to digital humanities development as I worked on a Ruby on Rails application. But I was really struck by the new way of thinking about my potential future and the way that I related to work. More than any new skill (though there were those too!), I took away a new community, one with different values and commitments than I had found elsewhere in the academy.
After the Praxis fellowship I bounced around a few different DH opportunities during the rest of my graduate degree. I project managed for NINES. I worked on the backend of a now defunct website for teaching rhetoric and composition. I started working with Eric Rochester 1:1 to learn about text analysis. And Wayne Graham invited me to co-teach humanities programming at HILT to get some more teaching chops. Laid out all at once like that, it sounds like I had a robust set of experiences professionalizing me in DH, and I was immeasurably lucky and privileged to have had these opportunities. At the time, things all felt very scattershot and taken on by random chance. I jumped at whatever opportunities appeared, but it never felt as though there was a clear path through school towards DH. I never thought of DH as a real career option for me even though I was accumulating a series of experiences in that direction.
Two conversations helped me to see a viable future in DH.
I professionalized during my degree as though I was planning to go on the academic job market. I published, went to conferences, etc. But I remember having a conversation with my dissertation director Michael Levenson towards the end of my degree about how my heart wasn’t in it. I explained to him that I felt pulled in three different directions: my research, teaching, and digital humanities. Michael could really read a room. He generously asked me why I was planning to apply to academic jobs I fundamentally didn’t want and encouraged me to embrace the pieces of my experience that really moved me. “Why would we only want people with PhDs in Universities?” is a quote from that discussion that stuck with me.  Many are not so lucky to have an advisor who was so willing to see futures beyond the professoriate. And many are not so lucky as to have the space and financial ability to determine their futures in this way. I ultimately decided not to go on the academic job market.
I started a long-term relationship with my wife around the same that my advisor helped free my own thinking from pursuing academic jobs for their own sake. She still had a few more years left at UVA in her PhD program, so I suddenly had personal reasons for wanting to stay semi-local. Two regional opportunities popped up on my radar: a developer position working in the UVA Library and a postdoctoral fellowship at Washington and Lee focused on digital humanities. I remember discussing the two job postings with Wayne while walking back from teaching programming together at HILT. I didn’t feel qualified for either position, but it felt like I couldn’t pass up local opportunities like these. Wayne encouraged me to think of my scattershot experiences as valuable. “Would I ever be qualified for something like this?” I asked. His response was generous and supportive. “You’re qualified now - definitely apply.” The Scholars’ Lab provided invaluable help to me as I went through the application process. I ultimately wound up taking the W&L postdoc for a number of reasons. The postdoc was more squarely a digital humanities position. It was also four years (an enormous and unusual length for a postdoc). And while they both focused on programming, I had the sense that the W&L position would be more flexible and allow me to move in different directions.
I stayed in the Washington and Lee position for just 15 months of the promised four years. I had hardly any experience in the small liberal arts scene, and in my time at W&L I came to deeply admire how pedagogy suffused all the work they did. These experiences helped me to shape a body of interests that could join what had until now felt like distinct pieces of my personality. Rather than thinking of DH, teaching, and research as separate, WLUDH showed me that these could all be one and the same. My colleagues at WLUDH made space for the position to grow with me. I still did some development work, but I was free to work more in the direction of pedagogy, curricular development, and OER than intended. I was actually teaching a course when I got a notification that UVA had posted the Head of Graduate Programs position after Purdom Lindblad left to be Assistant Director of Innovation and Learning at MITH.
In this context, the return to UVA, to the Scholars’ Lab, and my current position made a lot of sense. I was returning back to help administer the very programs that shaped me into the scholar practitioner that I had become. The Scholars’ Lab position was an opportunity to take the work I had done at W&L with teaching and return to a program that I could shape for years to come. From a personal standpoint, I was looking at the difference between an 80-minute and a 15-minute commute. And the move was also a jump from term-limited, contract employment to a position in which I was salaried on hard money. All the same, I agonized over the decision quite a bit. WLUDH and my colleagues there (shout out to Mackenzie Brooks and Julie Kane in particular) had made the space a really generative one that I was reluctant to leave. I remember taking a photo of an overlook on Route 81 on the afternoon of my last commute to commemorate the experience. I may have cried as the relief of leaving that commute behind washed over me.
And that’s where I’ve been for the last six years, coincidentally starting work at the Scholars’ Lab on the same day as my supervisor Amanda Visconti. I am eternally full of gratitude to the many mentors, collaborators, and friends who helped guide me on this path and gave advice as I struggled with decisions at hinge points. But I am also keenly aware of how much of my own path is the result of fortuitous  circumstances. Every time we run a fellowship application cycle I think about how my own life was changed by being on a waitlist. Every time I talk with a student I think about how fortunate I was to get the right encouragement at the right time. And I also am fully aware of how much privilege I enjoyed during this journey–both as a cis white man and as someone at a well-funded institution with resources to learn digital humanities. Whenever I see a post for a one-year postdoc I think about how enormously lucky I was to have the security of my multi-year contract at W&L. I want to pay forward the generosity I received to the next generation of DH graduate students, and this is a large part of why I blog publicly as much as I do. Both of my cover letters for the jobs mentioned in this post are available to read. But there is always more work to be done, on the systemic level as well as the individual. I see a direct line between the rambling path I took through graduate school and my current work with UCWVA-UVA, UVA’s wall-to-wall union. As a part of that group I organize alongside graduate students, faculty, and other staff to help make the road walked by the next person a little easier to follow, to make the academy more just and equitable for all. That’s really the subject of another post, though - less about origins and more about the futures we all hope to see in higher education.



To be fair to the teacher, she was modeling the format of the AP exam which would have us write dozens of lines of code out by hand in a booklet. Amanda Visconti has pointed out how ironic this is given my focus on minimalist digital pedagogy that focuses on pencil and paper activities. ↩

When working with students on DH pedagogy, one common question I get is how to run a classroom discussion. After all, some disciplines rely more on lecture-based approaches to instruction than conversation. Running a discussion can feel totally new for students unfamiliar to the format, especially so if the topic is DH-related. I wanted to share a short little trick you can use to ease into the format across topics and methods, including in DH.
A lot of the anxiety new instructors feel about running discussions comes back to silence. Dead air can be terrifying–the exact moment when imposter syndrome will flare up. When you ask a question and no one responds the instinct might be to answer it yourself. But this loop can create a space in which one gestures towards a discussion without actually giving the students space to speak up. Instead of back and forth, you produce what is essentially a lecture with performative discussion elements. Sometimes you do need to jump in. But often students actually need space to think–the silence in the room can be productive, and it rarely feels as threatening to the students as to the new instructor. The trick is to learn how to sit with the silence, to pause thoughtfully. I work through silences using a tactic that I’ve heard framed in different ways by a number of people, but I associate it most with Sophia Gu, a former colleague of mine in the UVA English Department. The tactic involves a pretty simple loop that you put into play whenever you ask a question in the classroom. You count to seven.

Ask a question to prompt discussion.
If you get a response, great! Move on.
If you get no response, count slowly to seven. Take a drink of water, stare at the ceiling, or otherwise busy yourself.
If you still get no response, reframe or clarify the question.
Count to seven again.
If you get to seven and still get no response you answer the question yourself.

I find that the simple fact of having a plan for the silence makes it much more manageable. It gives students the space to ask questions and gives your classroom the chance to have a real discussion.

I’ve always been someone who learns best while listening. And as I’ve gotten older and busier, I’ve had more and more need to find ways to keep up with work while taking care of other things. In the last six months I’ve started to do a deep dive into the DH resources out there available as audio, things that I can absorb during the cracks of the day. In the hopes of finding more, I posted to Mastodon asking if anyone had favorite recordings of DH talks, lectures, or workshops. The post got a fair amount of recirculation but few actual replies with links. That tells me there might be others interested in such materials, so I thought I would start a little running list of what I’ve been checking out and share it out. Keep in mind there is no real attempt at coverage here: it roughly collects whatever I’ve managed to find whenever I manage to check it out (I would love to hear what I’m missing!). So, the list is always going to be incomplete but be growing over time. I’m operating here under the assumption that there is enough here already to make it worth sharing. The scope is also quite broad but also idiosyncratic: there’s a clear focus on DH infrastructure and digital pedagogy given my own work. And I also won’t be keeping track, say, if things get taken down years from now.
What follows is my running list of recordings. There’s no real distinction made below between, say, podcasts you could download on your phone and videos that need to be run in the browser. Such a difference is meaningful but doesn’t really fit my own particular purposes here, so if you have need or one or the other you will have to poke around a bit. I’m using a service called BibBase to embed my Zotero collection on this page, so this post should be updated in the future as that collection updates. You can also explore the collection directly on Zotero’s website. I would recommend this guide by Yvonne Seale if you want to embed a Zotero bibliography in this same way on a page of your own. I also particularly want to shout out Merisa Martinez who shared a list of their favorite DH podcasts a few years ago. Thanks also to Amanda Visconti for suggesting some links on Mastodon. I’ve included those links in the Zotero collection below.
Free Digital Humanities Recordings

DH-relevant Audiobooks
These are longer texts that exist out there as audiobooks. Worth noting, though, that they may or may not be freely available. I found them either through a subscription service (like Audible) or rental from a library.

This post is primarily meant to be a resource for students interested in applying to one of the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowships. I often speak with people 1:1 about their applications to our Praxis or DH Fellows programs. These solo meetings are usually the best way to get to know someone and learn about their work, and I hope students will continue reaching out in this way. But I also always want the process to be transparent for everyone applying, and I want every applicant to have access to the same resources. So in what follows I try to collect the most useful information about how to apply successfully for one of our programs based on what repeatedly comes up in those conversations and at our information sessions (directly pulled from one piece of that slide deck). We always have more strong applicants than we can take into our programs, and asking the following questions of your application can help you to ensure you’re representing yourself in the best light. I also think several of the principles here are relevant to funding applications in general, so I’ll try to flag those moments where specific examples might be abstracted for a generalized approach to grant applications. For more grant-writing advice you might check out Thomas Padilla’s post or one of the NEH ODH’s posts on the topic. If you’re unfamiliar with our student programs, you might take a quick look at the CFPs for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities (referred to below as the DH Fellowship as is our local practice). In what follows I write with the understanding that you know something about them already.
Do you go beyond your research?
It’s not unusual for graduate students to spend a significant portion of their application describing their research. This is, of course, an expected part of your submission. It’s worth knowing, though, that I cannot recall a graduate student whose research was not interesting in its own way. You cannot take that interest for granted, of course, but the determining factors for our application committees rarely tend to come down to the nature of the research itself. Too much extended discussion of your own research in the abstract might not leave enough time to actually make the case for funding your work. In many cases, it can be valuable to develop a succinct way to describe the impact of your work that leaves plenty of space for the rest of your application. It’s often common practice for graduate students to develop elevator pitches for their work. It can be a good exercise to describe the urgency and impact of your work in writing in a similar mode. How would you cover your work in a page? A paragraph? A sentence? Then scale accordingly to the length of the application. Attention to this factor will give your application space to connect your work to the specific questions, values, and categories requested by the grant–you have room to go beyond a mere description of your project. More information below on this.
Do you know what you’re applying for?
One of the clearest ways you can strengthen your application is by rereading the call for applications and checking to make sure you understand the parameters of the opportunity for which you are applying. Then, demonstrate this by speaking to the nature of the experience in your application. This might feel like obvious advice but mismatches between applications and opportunities can often feel like low-hanging fruit for search committees struggling to make a range of difficult decisions. To give a concrete example: the Praxis program is a yearlong, collaborative fellowship. The students work on a range of activities every year. Much of those projects are co-designed by the cohort of students in consultation with and within parameters set by the Scholars’ Lab staff on a variety of topics. The program does not really contain a space within it to develop an original, individual research project. When writing a cover letter for Praxis, though, sometimes students pitch a research project they want the cohort to work on. No matter how interesting such a project might be, applications like these can raise concerns that a student knows what they are getting into. How will such a student feel when they don’t work on what they expect in the fellowship? Another application that directly speaks to the offerings of the program will look stronger by comparison. A better approach might be to describe future research projects that strike your interest while making it clear you are aware your work in Praxis will take you in directions you don’t anticipate.
If you know the opportunity well, you might be able to pitch something more out of the box. I once had a student, for example, pitch a pedagogical experiment for the DH Fellowship that fundamentally offered a critique of how we framed our CFP in a way that excluded research on teaching. This student was successful because they did a good job of demonstrating that they understood the fellowship and its goals, even if the CFP itself didn’t articulate them in the same way. But I would take such an approach with care: turning an application like this successful relies on you having done your homework and probably clearing the approach with a contact for the application (as this student did).
Do you have a plan?
In contrast to Praxis, the DH Fellowship project specifically asks students to propose a digital project to work on with us over the course of the year. Many students are used to describing the research interventions of their project but less familiar with how to describe the execution of a proposed digital project. Much of the CFP is directed towards guiding students through the process of describing how they anticipate that work going, and the strongest applications demonstrate a plan for the year, the technologies they might use, who in the lab will help them, projected outcomes, and more. Take these different hypothetical descriptions of the same project:

I want to make a website for my dissertation.
I want to make a digital archive based on a chapter in my dissertation.
I want to make a digital archive about American protests using Omeka. This project connects to a specific chapter in my dissertation.
Over the next year, I want to build a digital archive about American protest since the 1980s. Specifically, I plan to archive photographs from three important protests using Omeka. I plan to spend the first two months gathering materials and the next three assembling them into a proof-of-concept archive. If I manage to finish this in the time allotted, my future goals are to add new cities. I also think Dr. Nicolas Cage in the Lab could help supervise this work.

You could go far deeper, of course, but hopefully these quick examples show the varying degrees of specificity an application might contain. You do not, of course, need to know everything. If you did, you wouldn’t need us! To some degree this is a question of rhetoric: you can be honest about gaps in your knowledge while also showing that you have made your own best attempt to sketch out a strategy for carrying out the work that you have proposed. Sharing a plan for your work with us, however in-progress that plan might be, will go a long way towards letting the committee know that you know how we fit in and where to start. The DH Fellowship also asks for a review of relevant technology and literature, all of which is by way of asking for evidence that the applicant is already working to prepare themselves for a successful fellowship.
Is the proposal well-scoped?
Different funding opportunities call for different scales. The DH Fellowship in the Scholars’ Lab, for example, can be a bit flexible as outcomes go. We hope to prepare students so that, by the end of the year, they possess a proof-of-concept project with significant milestones as well as the skills to continue working in the future. Every DH shop in the world has been pitched projects that could be the work of a lifetime. Conversely, we’ve also all heard project pitches that estimated they would take a year but could actually be done relatively quickly (the dream!). The best applications are the ones that fit the amount of space and energy that the opportunity will give them, that don’t take a giant square peg and try to fit it in a small round hole. Ask yourself: am I planning on too much? Too little? These questions can often be difficult for students to ask of their own proposed projects, and it’s often best to consult with more experienced folks able to identify parts of a project proposal that might need to be reworked. Scholars’ Lab staff are always happy to help you scope your project before you apply. If you’re new to scoping projects and developing timelines for them, DevDH.org might prove to be a useful resource for basic lessons in project design. One option is to be honest about these difficulties in your application and offer tiered objectives, with some sense of a minimum viable product as well as stretch goals. It’s more difficult to fail if you have reasonably flexible expectations.
Do you address the terms of the application?
The Praxis and DH Fellowship CFPs both offer specific criteria to address in their respective applications in the form of a bulleted list. In each case, there are no tricks–these criteria form the evaluation rubric we use as we read cover letters. To use the Praxis application as an example, here is what we ask for:
To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiosity  can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews…

To go back to the earlier point on going beyond your research interests, note that research interests only directly pertain to one of the several categories we hope to see addressed. Too much space spent on any one category leaves less room for the others. The best applications are the ones that actually address each category in the way that we ask. We have, for example, sometimes gotten a CV or Resumé instead of a letter of interest. That genre mismatch often does the applicant a disservice, as there is less room to reflect on your experiences in those other genres. It’s often a good idea to go back to your materials after you’ve written them to compare them to the CFP as written. Did you address everything? Did you leave anything out?
Lastly - how can we help?
Every funding opportunity is going to have limited resources to go around. We want to make sure that our funding is as transformative as possible for those who receive it. This impact can take many shapes, and to some degree all of the above points are meant to help the committee determine how meaningful we will be for you. The fellowship might extend your research in new and interesting ways only possible with our support. You might need specific digital help with a particular project that you have been unable to get off the ground on your own. You might envision the fellowship as valuable training for careers off the tenure track. All of this points to what is, perhaps, the most salient point of this post, one in which I betray my background as a literary scholar. Grant and fellowship applications are acts of imagination. You are trying to write a particular future into existence. The committee, in its own way, is also trying to look to the horizon with your writing as a guide. When reading applications we try to project a future for the person in our community: will they be successful? How will their time with us prepare them for what is next? The way you structure the application itself can help or hinder this envisioning. Careful attention to the above categories can help make it easier for the committee to align their imagination with yours.

Premise 1: Digital humanities is vast. It encompasses an enormous and ever-growing group of people and institutions doing digital work across a broad range of languages, disciplines, and methods.
Premise 2: Everyone learns something for the first time.1
How, then, is an interested student new to digital humanities supposed to find their way towards the topic, method, or subject that will be their focus? How to find your future when you don’t know the past or present?
While there are many answers to these questions, I have come to rely on one activity when meeting with interested students new to the field. The exercise uses Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. I ask the student to compare their own interests to the collection to find a series of subareas within DH that they might want to explore further. This work usually happens informally in conversation. For the sake of this post and ease of use by others, I’ll write it out as a series of steps as though it were an assignment sheet to be given out to students.

Finding a Way into DH
This exercise will help you map your own research interests onto various areas within Digital Humanities using Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. The site organizes its pedagogical resources around particular topics like access, affect, annotation, and archive, to name a few. Each of these keywords contains a range of materials including syllabi, course projects, classroom activities, and more. And each topical section opens with a short headnote by an editor, expert in that field, contextualizing how that particular topic intersects with the broad field of digital pedagogy. We will make use of this structure to connect you to the field.


Describe your research interests in about a paragraph or so. No need to be lengthy, no need to worry about the audience, and no need to worry about being overly specific. This is for you. Great if you have some sense of what might interest you about DH, but broad and purely disciplinary interests also perfectly fine. We’ll connect them.


Take a few moments to read the table of contents for Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities. What do you notice?


Write down the 3-5 keywords that seem to intersect the most with your interests, the topics that most pop to you as urgent. You might even find that you used some of the same terms in the paragraph you wrote for step one. Taken together, this set of keywords will be the way that you triangulate one view of your relationship to DH.


For each keyword you circled, read the editorial headnote and peruse the artifacts collected under it.


To go further, take note of the other projects and scholars referenced in each editorial headnote. You can practice citation chaining to use this list to further enmesh yourself within your growing network of interests within DH.



Even though the resource in question is pedagogical in focus, I find the activity works well for students regardless of their interest in teaching. The exercise works especially well for folks at a stage of general curiosity but who have yet to find a specific project or interest. For students in this position, it can help them find a way to navigate the vast unknown by finding a constellation of materials close to their interests to get started. For those who already have more of an idea of their interests within DH the activity can facilitate a literature review. The exercise does not aim to be a comprehensive survey of the field. Instead, it starts from the premise that the only way to begin is by beginning–new students often just need guideposts to get started.



In the Scholars’ Lab we have an XKCD comic based around this premise taped to our wall. ↩

I’m going to try to re-enter blogging by intentionally writing short pieces more regularly. Bear with me as I try to find a voice in this new, shorter format. I’ll be breaking things that might otherwise be longer pieces into small nuggets that cover a single topic and then linking them together.
I thought I would start off by documenting some tools and ideas that I regularly use in conversations with students, beginning with how I discuss the range of DH careers with interested students. These talks often start with one key question: what kinds of jobs are out there?
There are several ways to approach to the topic, but I usually start conversations about careers in DH by drawing a very simple diagram: two axes, with the x-axis labeled as breadth and the y-axis as depth. The constellation of work involved in any given digital humanities position can be described in terms of a relationship between the two.

Breadth: generalized work across many different DH topics or methods
Depth: deep focus on a particular DH topic or method

All DH positions will ask you for some combination of these two variables, and any particular position will ask for a specific configuration of skills keyed to these axes. There is, of course, a degree of tension between the two categories: expertise tends to come at the sacrifice of generalized knowledge. Put another way, you can’t possibly know everything about everything (some jobs do ask this of you - a major red flag). I intend no value judgement in any direction with this way of thinking. Depth does not correlate to value or intellectual rigor: a position asking for specific expertise is not inherently better than one asking for broad surface familiarity. They’re just different.
To help students through this way of thinking, I then pull up our own staff page and chart a few positions along these axes. A couple examples at the extremes:
GIS Specialist - depth
We have two GIS specialists in our Lab that work on digital mapping needs for the entire university. These are perhaps the best examples of highly specialized positions because they quite literally have a particular area of focus on the title. The bread and butter of these kinds of positions entails deep work on a small number of methods. Another good example might be a DH developer hired to work on a specific DH grant project with a particular tech stack. If you’re hired as a developer for a Ruby on Rails project, your work will likely be primarily in Ruby on Rails.
DH Librarian - breadth
By contrast, some positions are more likely to be pulled in many directions and asked to know a little about a lot of things. A librarian usually provides support to whatever researchers come through the door. For example, I am not an expert in digital archives or digital mapping, but I know enough about these methods to have introductory consults with people and point them towards the right tools. There are others with more expertise I can send them to if they need further help. While I do have my own specialties (digital pedagogy and text analysis), my position also involves a mix of administrative, teaching, and development work and asks me to have surface-level knowledge of many areas. That work is often quite general, skewed towards breadth as opposed to depth.
Of course, most positions are likely to be murky, in the vast grey area between the two extremes. Faculty positions in digital humanities are perhaps instructive in this way. I would characterize these positions as rewarded by deep expertise and focused work in a smaller selection of topics. A DH faculty member might, say, work extensively on digital mapping and seek funding to that effect. But, at the same time, a faculty member might be called upon to design a DH curriculum or read DH grant applications on a broad array of topics. There is a push and pull between breadth and depth, each with their own rewards and risks as they pertain to the tenure and promotion process.
The tension between breadth and depth is further inflected by a range of other variables. The institution offering a job will affect its scope, as a library will have a different portfolio of work than, say, an art museum. Scale is another important factor: the larger an institution’s staff, the more likely it is for positions to be more highly specialized.
As with all binaries, this one breaks down under too much scrutiny. But I’ve still found it to be a useful starting point for getting students to think through the different types of futures for which they might prepare. My general advice to students is to think about how they might map themselves onto the axes of breadth vs depth. They should not feel compelled to be experts in everything, as they may get so lost in the pursuit of deep knowledge in one field that they never move on to another. By the same token, if there are one or two fields that really interest them, it’s okay to dive into those areas, rather than positioning themselves as generalists. In fact, I encourage students to select those topics and methods that they will approach in depth and distinguish them those from those that only require familiarity. This approach can help to make the process of professional development more manageable. And when trying to prepare for any given DH job ad they might find a student can ask: how broadly does this job ask me to go? In what directions?

I was recently asked to give a workshop for the Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium on how to manage the logistics for semester-long course projects. The result was something I came to call “Against Projecting: Planning DH Course Projects the Work for You.” The goal of it was to take that question and really get to the underlying pre-issues that, if ignored, can make things in the classroom much more difficult. That is to say - before we even get to the how of digital course projects we need to think through why we want to include them, what resources we have to support the work, and what shape they will take.
Here’s the abstract:
Many instructors include digital projects as the logical final assignments in digital humanities courses. Doing so introduces a host of challenges, however, and it can become all too easy to feel committed to the idea of the digital project in a way that overwhelms our course goals, our students, and ourselves. From a practical standpoint, this workshop will explore ways to manage the logistics of planning for the incorporation of course-long digital projects into teaching. From a theoretical one, this session will examine our reasons for doing so and how better to fit our project plans to our teaching rather than the other way around. The session will be structured as a mix of lecture, discussion, and activities, and participants will come away with a clear sense of next steps for integrating digital projects into their courses. In our limited time, the workshop will aim to deliver a series of tools and activities that participants can take with them to work through as they plan their own courses. Topics covered will likely include learning goals, resource assessment, scaffolding, assignment strategy, and outcomes, all filtered through the lens of project management for teaching and learning.
DEFCon records all their talks, so if you’re interested in more you can check out the video on their YouTube page (also embedded below). It’s a fantastic community - highly recommend following thier work!

The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,000 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia. We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,000 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both Brandon Walsh and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The student’s Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student’s application.
The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue (no more than two pages);
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that holding the fellowship can affect teaching rosters);
and your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot: February 23rd from 10-2 or 2-4 or February 24th from 1-3. This should be communicated in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together.

Applications are now open for the 2023-2024 Praxis Program cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2023. Consider spending some time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2023-2024 cohort - Tuesday, January 31st, 2023 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities, offered by the UVa Library’s Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students each year as they explore various aspects of digital humanities together. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, and share a range of digital humanities projects and activities over the course of the year. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named projects. Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family, and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Students developed Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA’s real estate development since the 1980’s, and Connection Established, an immersive examination of university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recently, students shared Your Name Here, a project that aims to empower students with the coding skills and confidence to create a personal website that reflects who they are and what they value in public. As a part of their training with us, student cohorts have published a range of values statements. They have also designed and taught digital humanities workshops based on their own interests.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups. We will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we are flexible and can certainly accommodate travel needs). We will monitor public health to ensure such meetings are possible–we have successfully held the program remotely during the pandemic.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. Students outside of GSAS or whose teaching would already be relieved through other sources during the fellowship year should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility given their particular cirumstances.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiousity can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Tuesday, 3/21 from 1-3 or Wednesday, 3/22 from 1-3 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview). Shortly after these group interviews, we will notify applicants who advance to schedule follow-up interviews should we decide such a round is necessary.

In addition, we ask for a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that the application can affect teaching rosters).
The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due March 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

Have a digital project you’d like to work on in conjunction with your dissertation? Applications are now open for the 2022-2023 Digital Humanities Fellowship cohort.
The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2022-2023 academic year is February 15th, 2022. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2022-2023 cohort - Tuesday, January 18th, 2022 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, encouraged to write to Brandon Walsh separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can begin your application.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1 The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both Brandon Walsh and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

and your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot, either on Wednesday, February 23rd from 2-4 or on Thursday, February 24th from 10-12. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise.

				Crossposted to Brandon's blog.
			
		
At MLA 2021, I was part of a panel  on “Perspectives on Digital Humanities Publishing” along with Jojo Karlin and Matthew K. Gold; Radhika Gajjala; and Gabriela Baeza Ventura and Carolina Villarroel. The lightly edited text of my talk follows along with my slides. As always, I tend to use the text as an outline and then expand or contract sections in the moment. More information on that strategy for public speaking can be found here.

Hello! I’m Brandon Walsh, Head of Student Programs in The Scholars’ Lab, a center for digital research in the University of Virginia Library. I’m also on the editorial board for The Programming Historian, and I’ll be talking today about the editorial processes we use to guide new lessons from submission to publication. In particular, I’ll be focusing on the technical platform we use for these workflows and how those technologies intersect with and inform the process itself.

I wanted to express gratitude up front to my co-presenters and to those whose work feeds into this talk. I, of course, need to thank the entire Programming Historian team, but it feels especially important to thank and acknowledge the non-English language teams working on the project–the Spanish, French, and (very soon!) Portuguese versions of the journal–since much of what I am discussing today focuses on their work. I should also acknowledge Matthew Lincoln, formerly the technical lead for the project, for the enormous labor he put into the technical infrastructure and workflows I’ll be discussing. And I also wanted to thank Jennifer Isasi, because the analytics I will mention came directly from her year-in-review blog post for the project.

By way of a roadmap – here’s what I’ll be discussing. After some brief background on the Programming Historian, I’ll discuss our editorial process and the technical platform, GitHub, we use to carry out those discussions and reviews. In particular, I’m going to highlight the costs and affordances of two aspects of it:

the slow, deliberate nature of working with the platform that enables translation and
the ways in which the platform force us to be extremely open and transparent.

And also, in case it’s useful for your ability to follow along with the talk, there is a link here to the rough text and slides of what I’ll be sharing.

Founded in 2008, The Programming Historian is a set of federated, open-access, and openly peer-reviewed journals that publishes novice-friendly articles on a range of different digital tools and workflows. The articles sit at the intersections of pedagogy and research. The idea is that someone who has, say, done work on network analysis with a particular corpus might then take that project and use it as a case study for a lesson with us that describes how others might perform network analysis themselves.
The project began by publishing in English and now includes 83 lessons in that language, but significant effort in recent years has been directed towards growing the project into other languages and for other communities. At this time of writing, the project contains 47 lessons in Spanish, 14 lessons in French, and a Portuguese version is soon to launch. We had 1.5 million visitors last year, but only about one third of those came from North America or the United Kingdom (more detailed analytics here). We work hard to think about this international audience. While the majority of our pieces right now originate in English, The Programming Historian has begun to receive original material in Spanish. And our goal is to accept original work in our other represented languages as well. A significant amount of the labor of the people on these project teams is directed to building the audience for their particular journals. Translating 80 lessons into a language like French is an enormous undertaking, and, in doing so, the editorial teams working in French aim to cultivate and engage with digital humanists working in that language who can then return to contribute their own original work.
But that is all subject for another talk. I have been on the English and technical teams for several years now, so I’m primarily going to be describing how we set up and facilitate the editorial processes that these non-English teams work through as they facilitate their massive translation projects.

Programming Historian began as an English-language publication, but now it is a set of journals with interlocking pieces. What I mean by that is that we have a set of journals that all share core architecture – general editorial guidelines, submission guidelines, and processes are shared among the journals. The public-facing pages for these components are all translated and kept in synch with one another if they change. These language-specific publications all use the same technical platform for submitting and reviewing work. But the translation projects are in various stages of completion, and the non-English journals are beginning to accept original lessons in their own languages. So core shared elements, but each journal acts independently according to their own timelines for production.

The primary thing I want to focus on today is how editorial activities intersect with technical platforms and the implications those technical choices, in turn, have for the identity, vision, and actions of the journals themselves. Parts of our process are quite familiar to other kinds of academic publishing workflows: we receive submissions by email, give editorial feedback upon accepting something for review, conduct open peer review, integrate feedback, etc. A few notable elements might be that we have a fairly turnaround from pitch to publication (six months to a year), we ask for pitches upfront rather than full manuscripts, and once we accept something into the review pipeline, we try to work generously with authors to see a piece to publication as much as we can. These pieces, in particular, are key to the vision of the project as we try to shape it.

These activities take place almost exclusively (save a few introductory emails) on a platform called GitHub. GitHub collects a suite of tools associated most closely with software development together, and I’ll go through a few that we’ve adapted for our editorial process along with the implications for doing so.

First, GitHub contains a suite of project management tools, and our peer review pipeline takes place in this system. In particular, we make heavy use of GitHub’s issue tracker for coordinating conversations about particular topics. Typical uses in the software management world for these tickets might be to collect information for acting on a bug report or gather conversation on a new feature. We lean on the conversational aspect of these tickets to manage our open peer review process. A new submission that has been accepted into the pipeline gets a new ticket that states where to find the lesson, shared expectations, and the editorial review of that piece takes place in public on this thread. Sometimes the public joins in unexpectedly, offering an unsolicited review or with words of encouragement about the new work. When we solicit reviews, they typically come in through this system. In addition to our review process, we handle 95% of internal conversations about the journal itself on this system which, again, periodically gets unexpected input from others outside the team. You can see here on the left an example review ticket on data normalization using pandas that I share with the author’s permission. On the right, you can see various editorial conversations about everything from bug reports to open debates about the identity of the project. They’re all happening in public.

A second aspect of the platform that we make substantial use of is GitHub’s file management system. GitHub makes use of Git, an extensive system for managing and resolving the changes made to files by groups of people. We actually use it for the work of managing the materials for our website itself. More on that in a second, but I first just wanted to give an example of what I mean by this sort of shared file management.
I imagine most people are probably more familiar with using Dropbox or Google Docs for collaborative authorship. Under those systems, the changes you make to documents are, usually, automatically synched. So, in this example, Fred or Lisa make changes to a shared Google Doc document that they can all see in real time. This is great in a lot of ways and has great implications for research and teaching, but it also has drawbacks. We’ve all been editing a Google Doc with a group of people when someone makes a huge change, shifting everything out of order. Not a big deal when you’re editing text, but when working with software you have to be more delicate about collaborating on your files. What distinguishes GitHub is that it is optimized for comparing changes on a line-by-line level. Rather than synching changes automatically, each part of the process – saving a change, sending it up to the cloud, retrieving someone else’s changes – requires its own command. So you can imagine how this process becomes much slower and more tied to each person’s identity. We can more easily pull apart the changes made by Lisa from those made by Dave. And when Dave inevitably messes up the project we could isolate his problematic changes and remove them. This core idea of shared editing in a slow, deliberate manner is something most of us regularly engage with. But because GitHub breaks out this editing process into so many steps (and adds an esoteric layer of vocabulary to each part of the process), the system is often very confusing for people.

GitHub is typically used for software development, so I wanted to start with an example of using it for just that. Before you is a typical example of what a change to a file looks like in GitHub’s interface for viewing them. GitHub calls this change a “commit,” and you’re looking at a representation of that change’s differences (a “diff”). This is from an old project of mine doing text analysis on punctuation in Virginia Woolf. I had found that the particular way I was searching for quotation marks wasn’t quite right, so I updated it. Looking at this diff briefly, GitHub makes it clear what I changed. Changes in red mean a line was subtracted, green means a line was added. So, you can see at a glance what was changed without having to do much visual collation on your own and without needing to be familiar with the project.

Here’s another example. On the Scholars’ Lab website we made a change to the markup for our blog, the information that tells your web browser how to display the site to visitors. Here we change, among other things, the phrase “who we are” to “what we do.” I bring up this example, in particular, because it moves in the direction of the kind of work we do as digital humanists. Digital projects represent a great deal of intellectual work, and that labor becomes bound up in the technical processes with which we carry them out. Here, the process by which we describe the lab for the web here is visible alongside the technical architecture for it. The self-formulation, the writing, is a part of GitHub. And it happens in public.

Here is one last series of diffs that I wanted to show from the Programming Historian’s presence on GitHub. We take advantage of this slow, belabored way of making changes as a means of facilitating translation work for the site. Lessons are translated in whole units. But I mentioned that we have core architecture for each journal that we want to stay relatively in synch. This is made complicated as the process by which we do things is constantly evolving. In the past few years, we have shared new guidelines for how to write sustainably, advice for how to write with an international audience in mind, and numerous changes to our submission process. Each of these changes has text that needs to be translated across the different language editions, and we want to make sure that things are current and not in various stages of completion. So, we use GitHub’s system to coordinate our efforts. What you see here is a change we are currently making to our editorial guidelines. I offer the new text for the change in English, flag the changes using GitHub’s system, and then the language teams use this interface to coordinate and manage the translation process. So here a few paragraphs get offered in English on the left, translated to French in the top-right diff, and translated to Portuguese in the bottom-right.

This process has several effects on our work. First, it means that any changes we make to our public-facing documents take a while to implement, because we make sure that all our public-facing changes almost always go into effect in all languages at once. Second and more importantly, this process has been especially useful for making the English team aware of the labor of translation. Any change we want to propose has ripple effects for the other teams downstream, so it helps to surface the human cost of tinkering with process. The English-language team is not the only one offering changes to the process that requires such work, but, perhaps because we have been working longest, I think we tend to be the most frequent culprits.
When it comes to our core site documents, we think of translation as a key part of our process that happens on an ongoing basis rather than something that happens after the fact. Besides the logistics of the process, this also raises the visibility and legibility of translation and internationalization as key parts of our process. The non-English language teams have done extraordinary work to ensure that we think of lessons that come into our pipeline as being bound for an international audience rather than solely as meant to live in a single language. Because of the advocacy and input of these teams, the project developed some guidelines for authors and editors on avoiding regionally specific language and ways to think about how to best structure a lesson for an international audience. And we’ve been discussing internally about whether some DH methods might be less translatable at their core and the implications this might have. All of this is to say that in terms of process and even down to technical architecture, we’ve been working hard in recent years to transition away from an English-first approach to editorial work and towards one that encourages many points of entry, with English just serving as one potential path in.

Another result of carrying out our work on GitHub is that the platform is heavily biased towards open. The project is as well. Our peer review and our technical architecture are public, but we’ve embraced this ethos to hold most of our editorial conversations in the open, meaning our churning is out there for anyone to see (or join in on!). Just as a few examples, on the top-right here is a screenshot of the conversation thread that lead to our sustainability guidelines. The other two conversations relate to ongoing efforts to make our editorial board, our authors, and our reviewers more diverse and friendlier to participants of a variety of genders. This work is far from finished. If you look at these threads and others, the project is frequently taken to task – internally and externally – for ways in which we can be better. In the same way that our lessons are openly peer reviewed, you might say that the journals themselves are constantly under open review. We’re in a perpetual state of revise and resubmit.

I also wanted to offer a few thoughts on the costs of this way of working. As I mentioned, we can move quickly in some ways but are quite slow in others. Our rolling deadline and quick publishing timeline make us quite quick by academic standards. But making changes to the underlying architecture and documentation of that editorial process, as evinced by the translation diffs I showed you, is an extremely slow and deliberative process. As I hope I have made clear, I actually think this is a very good thing, in that it helps us to think beyond a single language, makes more visible the labor that goes into translation, and increases collaboration across teams working in specific languages. But it should still be noted as an effect of the technical choices we have made.
Second, there are limits to how you can ethically carry out an open peer review process. No matter how much encouragement you give to people to be positive and generous in their readings, sometimes you get reviewers who are blunt or cruel. And no matter how much you work with an author, sometimes a work is not quite to a stage where it can be published. In situations like these, authors need the ability to opt their work and its review history out of the open – the stakes of such things for early-career scholars are just too high. Because we’re so tightly integrated with GitHub, which prioritizes openness and exhaustive record-keeping, it can be difficult to truly wipe something from the project history. It can be done, but doing so is a tad difficult because it works a bit at cross purposes to being on GitHub in the first place. So this bias towards an open archive is one caution I would offer to those considering carrying out editorial work in an environment like this.
One last thing I would note is that carrying out editorial process through GitHub is difficult and complicated. It requires a fair degree of technical fluency that most editors (and some authors) do not have when they come to work with us for the first time. Matthew Lincoln, who I mentioned early on, did an extraordinary job documenting in exhaustive detail how to work in this system, and we still regularly have issues. This is a common issue with “minimal computing” approaches to doing digital work, of which our project is an example. Our site uses a classic minimal computing stack – a Jekyll project coordinated and deployed through GitHub. This means that, from a technical standpoint, our work is more sustainable and requests less computing power for visitors. It also means that we’re pretty tightly in control of much of our publishing process and can change the look and feel of the project ourselves. But the cost is that we ask quite a lot of our editors to engage with the system, and it takes a lot of careful collaboration, assistance, and pair programming to make sure people are able to contribute.

If I haven’t scared you off with my last slide, I wanted to close with a resource in case you’re interested in learning more about how to implement this kind of pipeline on your own. The process for collaborative authorship I described here need not only apply to peer review journals. I mentioned that we applied a version of this system to the Scholars’ Lab blog, and I published a piece in the Programming Historian with Amanda Visconti and the Scholars’ Lab community that documents this process. We don’t cover how to internationalize your work and facilitate its translation. Lincoln has published a great blog post on how the Programming Historian does this piece in particular. But we do cover how to take a site meant for one person and turn it into a multi-author site with a pipeline for collaborative peer review. So, if you’re interested in setting up your own collaborative publishing space for a team you’re involved with you might check out that link.
That’s it for me – thank you very much!
Addendum: I got one question during the Q&A about how to convince other people to adopt this sort of stack for their own work. My response was to lean on the “costs” slide that I offered towards the end of the talk. Rather than assuming everyone needs to develop a pipeline like this in GitHub, I think any project team needs to look at their needs and the abilities of their group before committing to a system like this. To a large degree, this decision becomes a question of where your team wants to invest their energy. For some, that might very well be the kind of minimal computing setup we have here. For others, WordPress might make more sense. Our Programming Historian article has a short section on how to diagnose these needs and think about the costs and benefits of each.

The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2021-2022 academic year is Monday, February 15th, 2021. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2021-2022 cohort - January 19th, 2021 from 2:00-3:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, welcome to write to Brandon Walsh separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can get working.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in the fall.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1 The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both Brandon Walsh and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation;
and your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot, either on Wednesday, February 24th from 9-12 or 3-4 or on Thursday, February 25th from 9-11. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to express their interest and (once an application has been submitted) to let us know you have applied. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with this fellowship or otherwise.



Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award. ↩

Calling UVA graduate students! We’re still thinking about 2020, but it’s never too early to think about next year. Applications are now open for the 2021-2022 Praxis Program cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2021. Consider spending some time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2021-2022 cohort - February 2nd, 2021 from 2:00-3:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Recent projects include Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA’s real estate development since the 1980’s, and a project on critical approaches to DH education.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
and your availability on the day and times we’ve identified for interviews - March 22nd 2-4; March 23rd 10-2; or March 24th 10-11. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due March 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

Back in January, we in the Scholars’ Lab looked back fondly on all the public writing we had done together in 2019 and boldly looked ahead to all that we would do in 2020. We had big plans for putting more thoughts out in the world on a variety of topics. Then, of course, 2020 happened. In addition to the ongoing public health emergency, I have also been simmering with bottled rage about the full spectrum of political struggles related to the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, the ongoing climate emergency, and the Presidential election. Writing seems far less important now, with everything going on. All of this is to say that I, for one, have not been getting much blogging done. I felt a tremendous amount of guilt around this at first, as one typically does in academia when you have publicly declared yourself to be doing something that you cannot follow through on. But I have been trying to take the advice of Connor Kenaston, a former Praxis student, who advised his cohort at the beginnings of the pandemic to “be gentle with yourself.”
My version of being gentle has involved accepting that now is not the time to worry about putting new ideas into the world. When I had my comprehensive exams during my PhD, my advisor described graduate school to that point as a period of taking information in, as opposed to the new phase I was entering that would redirect that effort outwards as I looked towards the dissertation. Though of course it could be more nuanced, I think there is some truth to that binary: never before or since have I ever read as voraciously as I did during my graduate coursework and while studying for my exams. In the present moment I’ve found myself going backwards in a good way. While I have not been in a mental space conducive to writing, I have been trying to make more time for quiet reflection as I can. I have struggled in the last nine months to understand everything that is going on, in part because it defies easy explanation. I have been turning to others wiser than I am for guidance about how to respond to the ongoing emergencies in my own work, particularly as a means of trying to learn more about the struggles of students and colleagues whose experiences are different than mine. I’ve been spending more time reading, and I wanted to share a few things I have found especially useful.
On Financial Aid
I’ve written before that your perspective on what it currently is like to be a student is, fundamentally, going to be different from reality unless you are currently a student. And this gulf will deepen the further you age away from your own time as an enrolled student. I have my own experiences with student debt, but I wanted to read more about how students currently experience the financial aid process and its associated burdens. To that end, I read a significant chunk of Sara Goldrick-Rab’s Paying the Price: College Costs, Financial Aid, and the Betrayal of the American Dream. The book is exceptional in a number of ways, both for providing clear data that is helpful for informing conversations about student aid and debt as well as for the specific interviews that it offers drawn from students currently living through the process. Most helpful for me was the material that describes exactly how student aid (and, by association, debt) is calculated by financial aid offices. It is wildly more complicated than I ever could have imagined, and reading Goldrick-Rab’s work has helped give me a better understanding of the intersectional context for the student debt crisis and how it extends into graduate education.
On Food Scarcity
The pandemic has, in many ways, drawn attention to system inequalities already in place across the globe. The closure of schools has exacerbated food scarcity among those K-12 students who rely on school lunches. Goldrick-Rab’s work with the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice does an excellent job of showing just how much on food scarcity continues to be an issue for higher education. A useful piece that summarizes some of the issues is “It’s hard to study if you’re hungry.” A more pointed line that has been kicking around in my head since reading that piece is “it’s impossible to learn when you’re starving.”
On Loving Your Job
Katina Rogers recently published Putting the Humanities PhD to Work, a book I found incredibly useful on a broad range of topics related to graduate pedagogy and advising. I found her description of love as it pertains to one’s work especially useful: “the notion that one work’s ‘for love’ reflects a position of privilege that minimizes the struggle many academics face to support themselves, and renders invisible the barriers that exacerbate the challenges for women, people of color, people with disabilities, and others who are not well supported by the structures of academe” (22). The same description, of course, could work for a number of different careers, but that should not diminish the critique’s power as it pertains to higher education.
On Precarious Labor
I’ve been finding it helpful to read about labor advocacy, both in digital humanities and otherwise, as a way of understanding how the pandemic has exacerbated the economic and power disparities that have always existed in the university structure. Precarious Labor in the Digital Humanities by Christina Boyles, Anne Cong-Huyen, Carrie Johnston, Jim McGrath, and Amanda Phillips is an excellent way in for those of us working digital humanities. In addition, the coverage of the University of Michigan graduate students and RAs strike over their administration’s response to COVID-19 has been instructive for the kind of solidarity and activism that our current moment calls for.
On Student Surveillance
It feels like we all live on Zoom now, and I am very grateful to those who have drawn attention to the insidious effects of video technology used for pedagogy on student privacy. Asking students to turn their video on during a call, for example, can involve inviting a student’s instructor and peers into their private economic and social circumstances in ways that can be harmful. Shea Swauger, writing on the related issue of algorithmic test proctoring, argues that “Cheating is not a technological problem, but a social and pedagogical problem. Technology is often blamed for creating the conditions in which cheating proliferates and is then offered as the solution to the problem it created; both claims are false.” I especially appreciated the ways in which Swauger ties technological solutions to online cheating as ultimately encoding a eugenic gaze into the classroom. Zoom often feels like something I just switch on as a part of starting my working day, but pieces like this have been helpful for thinking through the pedagogical and ethical implications of it and related platforms.
There’s no clear sign that we’re getting back to normal anytime soon, and I’m grateful to these authors for the guidance they offer for navigating our current circumstances. They’ve made me a better teacher and colleague.

When I studied music in school, we were all given a listening placement test. First, the graduate student in charge would play a series of melodies and harmonies for us, and we were asked to notate them. The second test exercised the inverse skills: given a sheet of music we were asked to sing what we saw in front of us. In each case, we were graded on how accurately we were able to convert sound to written notation and back again. All incoming music majors were slotted into one of six sections based on the results of our ear training test, and I placed into the bottom one. Even the most basic skill–pitch matching, or the ability to hear a note and sing that same note back–was a challenge for me. Twice a week for the rest of the semester, the students in my section filed into a basement classroom and made noise around a piano in what must have been an excruciating experience for the trained music doctoral student who taught us.
Over the course of the year, that teacher worked with us to develop “big ears.” This term refers to a number of overlapping concepts from the music industry that, together, represent an exceptionally strong attention to the nuances of musicmaking and the collaborations required for performance. Ashley Capps, organizer of the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee, described it in this way: “The term ‘big ears’ is also slang in the music industry that describes being an especially acute and perceptive listener […] So, a great sound engineer, a DJ who has an affinity for picking hit songs or simply someone who listens broadly and deeply—they’re all said to have big ears.” I’ve heard the term a few times over the years. Most recently, on The Musician’s Guide to Being Healthy, Wealthy & Wise, a podcast about the music industry, it was used to describe a performer who was especially strong at perceiving what others were playing. In that context, it was specifically used to refer to someone with strong aural skills, a term that refers to the ability to hear pitch, harmony, intervals, melodies, and similar characteristics of music and identify them based solely or primarily on hearing.
Listening in this way—with big ears—is challenging, but it is a skill that can be learned. Each semester as a music student, I had to take a version of that same ear training placement test. Each time I got a lot wrong, but the care and attention of the instructors helped me, over time, to get a little more right. By my sixth semester I made it into the fifth section—not quite the top group of students but close! My last undergraduate semester involved singing a lot of Bach chorales twice a week each morning. I am still far from the best, but I continue to improve to this day. I don’t have a musicianship class anymore, but I do have an app for my phone that helps me to keep practicing. You can always get better at listening.
This is one of my favorite stories about learning because it takes something that appears magical and wholly out of reach and shows that, with time and practice, it is a skill that can be developed by anyone. It’s also a story, I think, about teaching. How easy would it have been for my instructor to belittle me as I struggled to get started with singing? Instead, my teacher listened—however hard that might have been for them. The story feels especially relevant for the present moment, because it’s fundamentally about how those in power do or do not listen to those in their care.
It feels impossible to work right now, let alone teach, when so many people are barely holding families, institutions, and themselves together. How can we work with students under these conditions, when it feels, so often, as though the important voices of those doing the work go unheard? The students and staff that inhabit our educational spaces, that maintain them, and that labor in them are struggling through catastrophe. We are bodies, dealing with the physical and emotional strain of a public health emergency. Now, more than ever, the work of the classroom requires careful attention and, I think, a pedagogy of radical empathy. A renewed focus on intentional and purposeful listening, even—and especially—as it is devalued around us.
When we moved online this spring, I, like many instructors, struggled to transition my work to an entirely virtual format. But I also knew it was entirely necessary. My students in the Praxis Program were in the thick of shaping what their developing project would look like and how to implement it. When the students and I were able to touch base in our first online Zoom meeting, I made one thing clear: their well-being came first. Even if the students produced no final project as originally planned, that was perfectly acceptable. They were already successes to us. Then, I asked them to take some time to think together about what they wanted to do as a team. These were not empty promises: I was prepared to fully back up whatever choice the students made.
In a number ways, our ability to focus heavily on students’ well-being was enabled by privilege. Because the Scholars’ Lab operates a fellowship program from the library, I don’t have to give grades and the outcomes can be quite flexible. There are, however, a range of thinkers in critical digital pedagogy, including Jesse Stommel and Sean Michael Morris, who have written eloquently on how such choices are good, ethical pedagogy that can and should be explored by all teachers such as they are able. Other critics, too, have talked about the importance of empathetic attention to students’ needs during the present moment. Pedagogy and American Literary Studies has suggested that you might not need that absence policy right now. Michelle Pacansky-Brock has offered a model survey for checking on your students’ needs during this difficult time. Matthew Cheney and Catherine Denial have each argued for modifying our syllabi and our pedagogies to be founded on kindness rather than abuse. There are many more ideas in circulation, and the ones that most resonate with me are those that accommodate the urgent and pressing needs of others, of those students and collaborators who are caring for children, lack access to broadband internet, or are worried for loved ones.
When we resumed meetings, it was clear that the students wanted to forge ahead and complete their project, but we also recognized that the nature of the community had changed. I think by offering the possibility of an extreme (though, in my view, ethical) response to the pandemic, they, an already cohesive and close group, became even more caring for one another. For the rest of the semester, we had regular check-ins, individually and collectively on personal well-being. We cared for each other as people even as the work carried forward. The project resulted in Land and Legacy, an incisive look at the University of Virginia’s and the University of Virginia Foundation’s land expansion in Charlottesville and Albemarle County since the 1980s.
For me, these ideas are part of a broad pedagogy of deep listening—that is, of hearing students’ needs as both thinkers and people and structuring a learning environment to accommodate them. Listening in this way is not passive. Instead, it borrows from musicians, for whom listening is always a process of attention and response. In their collection entitled, appropriately enough, Big Ears: Listening for Gender in Jazz Studies Nichole T. Rustin and Sherrie Tucker quote Ingrid Monson on listening: “[jazz musicians] mean it in a very active sense: they must listen closely because they are continually called upon to respond to and participate in an ongoing flow of musical action that can change or surprise them at any moment” (1). Listening—real listening—is about careful attention to the whole, your part in the collective, and how you can grow together. Sometimes that means staying silent. Sometimes that means making noise. It always means paying attention to what the group needs.
Listening, in these terms, is the action by which the collective forms itself. Whether teaching in-person, hybrid, or online this fall, whether talking about the classroom, the administrative planning meeting, or the ballot box in November: voices are likely to be silenced. Committing to listening does not mean inaction in the face of these oppressive systems. Sean Michael Morris gets at a similar point in “Not Enough Voices,” when he discusses his own anxiety over speaking too much: “The answer doesn’t lie in turn-taking, but in changing what it means to speak. Make speaking a collaborative event. Join your voice with the voice of students. Join your voice with the voice of other teachers.” In these terms, a pedagogy of listening is one that attends to voices, one that helps make space for equitable terms of engagement. This sense of listening, one that is born of and that leads to collective action, is something we need now more than ever. Right now, we need teachers and administrators who are ready to listen, to make space, and to speak up. To hear, echo, and amplify the voices of their students.
There is much more to say about pedagogies of listening. For now I will end with one last quote, this one from Igor Stravinsky: “To listen is an effort, and just to hear is no merit. A duck hears also.” Don’t be a duck. People aren’t born good at listening. Teaching with big ears is a skill you can practice, and there’s no better time than the present.

I finished drafting this post back before the extent of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming known. And now, of course, the impact of the virus around the globe—and on higher education in particular—continues to evolve. So I had been sitting on this post for some time; I wasn’t sure how a rapidly changing landscape of higher education, replete with hiring freezes and bleak budgetary outlooks, might impact these conversations. I’m still uncertain. But I’m publishing this now in the expectation that ethical conversations about budgets as they pertain to students and teaching are likely to become more important now than ever. I’m grateful to Mackenzie Brooks, Amanda Visconti, and Elizabeth Fox for reading the post over.
Caveats aside—this post is part of a larger project I’m working on over the course of the year about the intersections of digital humanities pedagogy as it can reflect and enact infrastructural change in higher education. While each post is meant to stand on its own, they do participate in a longer conversation. It might be helpful to explore the framing post for the series for context.
I will talk elsewhere about opportunities for pedagogical interventions in the context of credit-bearing courses. For now, I wanted to speak primarily from my own institutional perspective. As the Head of Student Programs for a library-based center for digital research, the teaching that I do tends not to happen in for-credit courses. Instead, my teaching takes place in a range of activities: year-long student fellowships that carry a stipend that I design and administer in collaboration with the rest of the Scholars’ Lab, one-on-one consultations, one-off workshops, and more. Roughly half of my working life is spent on the actual work of theorizing and carrying out teaching. The other half is spent on developing the administrative infrastructure to allow such work to happen, for myself and others. With that in mind, I wanted to pause over the kinds of pedagogical interventions that can be made by people in these kinds of positions—whether we describe them as alt-academic, para-academic, academic, or otherwise. For that reason, the following does not apply so much to teaching in credit bearing courses, though it might offer useful food for thought as it applies to a range of pedagogical situations.
Sean Michael Morris refers to a pedagogical habitus, “embodied practice, often uninspected or subterranean to a person’s own thinking about themselves,” that forms the “genetic makeup” of an instructor’s teaching. In this line of thought, pedagogy is not just a practice–it is more properly thought of as your general attitude towards the work of teaching that you do. Put simply, your pedagogy is reflected in every action you take that could potentially affect students and your attitudes towards all such actions. It’s not too much of an exaggeration, I think, to say that with this frame of thinking every action can be considered a pedagogical one. No administrative decision is too small to affect students in some way.
I often point to budgets as the clearest example of how mundane administrative details, seemingly disconnected from the work of the classroom, have profound ramifications for teachers and learners. To put the finest point on it: your budget is a pedagogical issue. It’s also a question of equity. The economic circumstances your program creates or participates in directly affect the kinds of people able to participate in your programs and the work they can do.
Higher education is a time of enormous financial uncertainty for many students. Sara Goldrick-Rab’s work with #realcollege, for example, has brought attention to the number of college students that struggle with food and housing insecurity. The situation is often no better for graduate students who, even if their programs offer tuition remission and stipends, are frequently forced to live in poverty. B. Mano’s piece on their particular circumstances at MIT sheds light, in particular, on how specific institutional policies can intersect with national labor and immigration law to produce especially dire situations for students. In these circumstances, any decision that we make as administrators can have dire consequences for the lives of the students around us.
Of course, every situation is different and subject to different pressures. Many institutions doing digital work simply don’t have any budget or funding at all. If you’re in a position like this, it might feel difficult to imagine how you could structure financial circumstances for your students in a more equitable manner when you’re still trying to find any kind of firm structure at all. In what follows I don’t mean to propose the perfect as the enemy of the good. Instead, I’d suggest taking the following as opportunities to examine where you’re at in the hopes of finding a way towards better outcomes—whatever “better” means for you and your circumstances. At the very least, I hope that the following discussion can supply resources and questions to use as we all try to advocate for better labor conditions for students.
Four pedagogical questions that you might ask of the student side of your budget are:

Does it exist?
Is it stable?
Is it transparent?
Is it what my students need?

Does it exist?
Are students a part of your budget? If not, why? In Elissa Frankle’s ignite talk entitled “Pay Your F-ing Interns,” she describes how unpaid internships reinforce whiteness and homogenous, privileged communities in museum workers. Frankle goes on: “We may say that we value diversity, that of course we want to treat our workers well, but do our core documents and budgets reflect that fact?” Our decisions about infrastructure, at their best, should reflect what our organizations believe in. A first useful question you can ask of your budget, then, is, whether and to what degree your work with students rises to the level of budget lines and conversations during allocations.
What you can pay is, of course, a local issue. But it is worth questioning whether your current payment practices are the result of habit or limitations. At UVA, we are subject to a range of policies that impact what we can offer students. It’s important to know what these are at your institution so that you can answer statements like “we can only pay X” with “actually, the policy states we can pay X+Y.” I often find state and local policies as a useful first tool when advocating for students, and they can also provide common language for working with financial administrators elsewhere in your institution who might be more removed from the day-to-day lives of your students.
Even if you’re not instituting something as formal as an internship or an hourly position, it’s worth considering how much unpaid time you’re asking of your students. Asking students to drive visiting speakers to events, for example, might appear negligible for the amount of effort it requires. But this small ask still takes a student’s time, time that they could be applying to their own work, to another paid position, or to personal needs.
In short, recognize the economic impact you are likely already having on students and decide whether you can do better. Recognize what you ask of them, first, and second ask what you can pay them.
Is it stable?
Students need to be able to plan their finances. If they cannot, only students from affluent backgrounds will be able to make decisions about their educations in the face of such uncertainty. If we want to design programs for students that will be as inclusive as possible, we need to strive for better stability in what we can offer. I am well aware that stable budgets are a luxury in most institutions, including my own. This is especially true in digital humanities, where people and organizations have successfully lobbied IMLS, CLIR, the Mellon Foundation, and the NEH ODH for substantial grants to support their work.
Grant funding can provide valuable experience for students and resources for paying them for their labor. And at some institutions these avenues might be the only ones available for funding the work of you and your students. Grants come with the disadvantage, of course, that they will eventually run their course. Soft money can provide useful supplemental resources for employing students, but the associated instability can cause long-term issues for students and staff. For example, a term-limited grant-funded student position might be listed as one year with year extension contingent on successful performance. In such a situation, the student or postdoctoral worker will spend a significant portion of their time planning and searching for what comes next when the grant-funded position ends. Extensions to a contracted position might, of course, be more dependent on successful lobbying for continued funding than on faith in an already carefully vetted candidate. But it’s still worth considering the real-life ramifications these positions can have for candidates.
It is worth noting the benefits of stable student programs founded on hard money. Through a combination of advocacy and strategic planning, the Lab has been fortunate enough to offer two stable fellowships for several years now. Praxis is completing its ninth year, and our Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is in its thirteenth year. This means that students can plan on these programs as possibilities for them as they plot out not just their research agenda during their time with us, but also their plans for applying for supplemental funding. It is truly unfortunate that we cannot accept everyone who applies, but we work hard to try to bring as many people as we can into our community. It takes time for research agendas to develop, and students need time to decide if such things are right for them. The Scholars’ Lab has application cycles that run virtually all year long for its various programs, and students discuss their intention to apply well in advance of when they are eligible to do so.
Stable programs lead to better support for students as well. Supporting students requires time and energy from staff, no matter how experienced and skilled they might be. Thoughtful and considerate planning that includes student support as part of the regular workload for staff ensures that teaching and pedagogy will not become afterthoughts. Even if suddenly presented with the financial option to take on new students, one should ask if they can be supported.
Good teaching follows from well-supported and energized staff who are empowered to decide if they have the bandwidth to take on new students. Good learning follows from students who can make informed decisions about their lives and have the time and space to commit to learning.
Is it transparent?
I often find that students have received no real information about the systems by which their finances get processed. On the one hand, this is understandable—university budgeting processes are byzantine, and information about payment processing might seem like a means to an end and less crucial to students’ day-to-day lives. But providing knowledge about these systems can help students plan their own lives more capably. I have found it helpful to make sure students are aware of a range of different components related to how their payments are processed:

University payroll calendars
The length of time it takes for a payment to process
Whether a payment will be taxed up front or not
Whether a certain amount of payment during the year triggers automatic taxation
When payments are likely to come through, how often, and in what amount

Each of these elements can help students plan their time and finances. In addition, I’ve found that it can be difficult for us to track when something goes wrong in a payment that we’ve issued. We know when we issue it, and we find out if a student gets their funds. But there are many steps along the way. With many, many links in the administrative chain before the money actually gets dispersed to students, there are many places where things could go wrong. So I have regular appointments on my calendar when I ask students to make sure that they’ve been paid as expected. I often find students are really patient and willing to wait even if it appears that something might be amiss. But, as payments take time to process, I would rather we be in constant communication and transparent about where things stand so that we can reduce the burden on students already living in states of financial precarity. A transparent budgeting and dispersal process is a more ethical one.
Is it what they need?
Lastly, any administrative process can be enhanced by student input. As is often the case with teaching, I find the best way to grow is to ask students for their insights. Put simply, unless you were a student very recently, you probably do not know what sorts of pressures your students are subject to. Unless you recently lived paycheck to paycheck, it might be easy to forget the sort of financial precarity that a number of our students live under. And it is impossible for any one person to have personal experience that tracks with every possible student experience in the world. In short, be wary of invoking Students with a capital ‘s’, as one broad monolithic community. In order to take a broad, intersectional approach to your teaching and administration, you must talk with students themselves. They are experts on their own situations, and talking with your students about their needs can help to inform your decisions. They’ll learn more about how the university works, and the teaching and pedagogy you can offer will be enhanced as it more closely matches the real-world experiences of your community.
We address this same point in the Scholars’ Lab Student Programs Charter:

We teach in public, meaning that we talk openly about our pedagogical process. When possible, we write about it as well. If something is not working, we will change it and adapt based on the needs of the students and our colleagues. Accordingly, we expect our students to talk and write about their work and the learning process for them, to engage in the experience, and help us shape a pedagogical experience that works for them.

To engage your students directly in conversations like those above is to treat them as peers, as collaborators in the learning process in all of its messiness. Details like these might seem removed from teaching or overly specific. But they have material effects on the day-to-live lives of your student collaborators. A conversation with a student about how the uncertainties around a particular fellowship payment, for example, helped us to understand that a different distribution calendar would offer students more cushion if payments were delayed. We wouldn’t have gotten the idea had we not talked with the student directly about their needs.
As mentioned above, it can be difficult to balance these conversations against the realities of trying to do this work. We don’t live in a perfect world, and we’re all working with limited resources. Talking with students directly can be a way of sussing out whether your budgetary situation is operating for them and their lives and how it might work better for them. Students can help us all find our way to more equitable pedagogies and budgets that reflect them. You cannot do everything, but you might be able to adjust a few things. In the current climate of higher education, when many are faced with hiring freezes, across-the-board budget cuts, the prospect of layoffs, and withdrawn job offers, such conversations might seem small. But small decisions can matter in big ways for your students. And they can help us care for our vulnerable community members during chaotic times.

Amanda, Ammon, and I have been discussing our plans for the upcoming year of blogging. While last year’s blogging push was invigorating and exciting, we wanted things to be slightly different in the coming year. In particular, we’ve been talking about wanting more continuity in the things we publish. Speaking for myself, it often felt like I was blogging just in time and on deadline. Some good things came out of that work, but I liked the idea of putting just a little more thinking into the project ahead of time so that I could blog around a central topic for the year. Amanda and Ammon have been incredibly helpful in talking about all this with me.
Truthfully, I’ve been feeling the lack of a large writing project lately. After my dissertation, I worked on a text analysis coursebook with Sarah Horowitz, a faculty colleague at W&L. I adore blogging, but I feel the lure of a large project I can chip away at over the next year and that can draw together my energy. Am I talking about writing a book? Maybe? We’ll see. I’m certainly not the first person to write a book in public, but the idea of revealing what I was aiming for made me feel a little uneasy. What if my ideas didn’t cohere (I tend to write in multiple sections of a project at once)? What if I didn’t actually produce anything or finish? What if the project turned out to be empty (easier to dismiss a single blog post)? Does what I’m interested in working on even need to be a book? What do I mean by book - is it a published thing with a press or just something big that lives online?
I had initially planned on just quietly blogging around a cluster of ideas over the next year and then potentially revealing at the end that they were part of a coherent project in progress. But as I started to write the first post on imposter syndrome (seriously)- and in the midst of talking with my students about the very topic - I thought I should put my money where my mouth is from the outset. So here you go! Here are my notes on the large, ongoing, multifaceted writing project that I’ll be trying to cohere together over the course of the next year. If it winds up being something I try to actually turn into a book so be it. If it just winds up being a series of blog posts, then I’ll at least be happy to have written about topics I felt were urgent.
One last note on process: in my PhD program we did an activity where we repeatedly drafted a fantasy table of contents for our dissertation. No abstracts necessary at that stage - just a title for the project and titles for the chapters. I found it enormously useful as a means for thinking through the different shapes a large writing project could take. That’s essentially what I do below. I try on a provisional title for the large project and take a spin at some rough chapter ideas. Since this is a blogging endeavor to begin with, within each chapter title I offer some titles, topics, or questions for blog posts that might intersect with it. I flag a few thinkers and discourses that I see this all drawing upon and engaging with. I also offer a few beginning thoughts towards a topic (nothing surprising, if you’ve read other posts by me on here). My arguments always tend to emerge in the process of writing, though, so it will be interesting to see how this develops over the course of a year. So take this for what it is - a sketch of a sketch of things I find urgent and will be trying to attend to over the coming months. Stay tuned for a look into my messy process.
I thought I might start by close reading this provisional, draft-y title as a way of getting at the ideas I want to explore. For now, at least, I’m thinking about it as called Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind.
Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind

Our pedagogy model and reflect the kind of academic community we want to see in the  world. Academia is toxic in numerous ways. Teaching and the ways we theorize and practice it can be interventions in the culture around us. The project hopes to connect classroom practice broadly construed with the kinds of infrastructural changes they reflect and enact.
Kindness is at the core of the project. I’m trying to formulate a theory of DH pedagogy that is, at its core, one about developing a less toxic and more affirmative space for students in higher education. It’s about developing empathy and kindness as teachers and how DH can (or cannot?) offer us the space to do so within and against the infrastructures of academia.
Finally, at least in this title, I wanted to get at the idea of paying a debt in goods and services rather than in cash. For starters, I like this formulation because it draws in a range of topics. What do we owe our students? It raises the specter of student debt. And it draws in Paulo Freire and questions of neoliberal, zero-sum teaching. Is digital humanities fundamentally bound up in neoliberal politics of the university? Yes. How can we develop an ethical, just, and progressive pedagogy anyway and in the face of this?

A starting list of thinkers I imagine the project in dialogue with: Cathy Davidson, Katina Rogers, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Jeremy Boggs and Purdom Lindblad, Hannah Alpert-Abrams, Amanda Henrichs, Roopika Risam, Sara Goldrick-Rab; Jesse Stommel and Sean Michael Morris, Matthew Cheney, Catherine Denial, bell hooks, Paulo Freire; Shawn Graham; Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers; Brian Croxall; Carolina Villarroel, Gabriela Baeza Ventura, Trevor Muñoz (and more). Significant projects that I’d examine and reflect on would include the UCLA Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights, the Collaborators Bill of Rights, The Futures Initiative, HASTAC, Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities,  ILiADS, #generousthinking, The Postdoctoral Laborers Bill of Rights, the Academic Job Market Support Network, AADHum, and USLDH, among others. In my mind I want to tie together questions of higher education reform, critical digital pedagogy, and DH pedagogy. I’m certain I’m leaving people and projects out in this short and initial list - such is the nature of blogging about a work in progress. I’ll be working on a Zotero bibliography that collects these resources for myself and others as I continue reading around about the important work already being done in these areas.
I imagine the project offering a theory and praxis of DH teaching and pedagogy - very broadly construed, as it tries to develop a theory of pedagogy far beyond the classroom -  as an intervention in academic culture. DH pedagogy offers a number of great interventions to begin with – meditations on failure, teaching as activism, rethinking the professional futures of humanities students – and I’d like to join those conversations with others from critical digital pedagogy that emphasize radically student-centered teaching. With these frameworks, I’ll focus the work on the conditions of being a DH student – the material labor and working circumstances, the conditions of professional development and career prospects, the intersections of administrative decisions and the economic conditions of student life. I think doing so will help to give a better sense of the lives at the core of DH pedagogy as they intersect with the administrative infrastructures of DH. And perhaps ultimately the project aims to argue for a pedagogy that teaches with and alongside students and with kindness that happens together (a lot of echoes of Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Generous Thinking here).
That’s where I’m at right now at least. Lots of loose threads and jumbled thoughts but at least a place to get started. One unresolved question for me is what makes this an argument about DH and not just pedagogy in general? Is it DH just because I am a DH person? Or does DH specifically have something to say about this? Is the DH audience, in particular, a good one for this? Or not? Things I’ll want to think further about in the future for certain. Without further ado, though, I’ll close with the draft table of contents and associated blog topics / questions. The arc of the project as I’m thinking it at the moment moves from micro to macro, from the classroom to larger questions of professional climate.
Draft Table of Contents and Ideas

Introduction
    
Where does DH teaching happen?
Where does infrastructural change happen?

How do we make the classroom a space where students can be sheltered from the academy and also create the conditions to transform it a la Jacqueline Wernimont?
What are the spaces of teaching, for DH in particular?


Labor
    
DH students as DH teachers
Neoliberal DH pedagogies
Expanding on the UCLA Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights
Precarious labor and the labor of teaching


Infrastructure
    
As it impacts pedagogy and student life and teaching in particular; how do the small decisions we make at the level of administration reflect out pedagogies?
How can pedagogy be enacted beyond the classroom? How can we take teacherly actions as administrators?
How can those teacherly administrative actions address issues of precarity among the student population?
Your budget is a question of pedagogy and justice


Profession
    
Imposter syndrome. Where does imposter syndrome start for students? How can we address it?
Professional Development / Career Paths
Professional Imposters
Small changes / big changes


Conclusion – on inclusivity
    
How do we invite students into the profession and into higher education in a way that makes their voices heard and valued?
How can we ensure students are valued in online spaces? Or welcomed in spaces of open peer review?
Where to go from here?



Seems like plenty to go on for now. Now to get blogging!

Calling UVA graduate students! The spring semester is just beginning, but it’s never too early to think about next year. Applications are now open for the 2020-2021 cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2020. Consider spending some time with us!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the program on Wednesday, February 19th from 11AM-12PM in New Cabell Hall 236. You are, of course, welcome to write to Brandon Walsh separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Graduate Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 1-2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow;
and your availability on the days we’ve identified for sixty-minute group interviews - March 23rd from 1-3pm or March 24th from 10-11. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to express their interest and (once an application has been submitted) to let us know you have applied. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

In September, I visited Emory University in conjunction with the launch of their new graduate fellowship for students aiming to incorporate digital projects in their dissertations. This is the second of two posts sharing materials from the events I took part in while there. I was asked to give a workshop on project development for graduate students as well as an open talk on digital humanities pedagogy. The text of what follows pertains to the open talk I gave, where I was asked to give a broad overview of how the Scholars’ Lab works with students. I write a talk for situations like these, but I try to avoid straight-up reading the text (more info on how I approach public speaking in DH available here). So what you will see below is more like a roadmap of the general gist of what we talked about. I did not consult the text too much in the moment. The only other relevant piece of framing that you will need is that I added the phrase “he works for the students” to the end of the bio I gave Sarah McKee (Senior Associate Director for Publishing at the Bill and Carol Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry) to read when she introduced me. Talk begins below!


Hello! I’m Brandon Walsh. I am the Head of Student Programs at the Scholars’ Lab, a community lab for experimental scholarship in all fields, particularly informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage. You will hear a lot more about what we mean by that in the talk to come, one that I have titled “Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Opportunities for Hope.” Thank you so much for having me and for coming today to hear me talk. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you.

I wanted to first start out by offering a couple links and thanks. If you need access to the slides or the transcript of this talk (or you’re interested in what I shared with your students in the workshop earlier today), you can find those resources at this top link. I have also made a Zotero collection here with all the resources I mention in the talk in case you want to take a look at them later on. And finally, most importantly, I wanted to take a moment to express gratitude to everyone whose work has brought me here today. I’m very grateful to all my colleagues in the Scholars’ Lab whose work you will hear about in a moment, especially Amanda Visconti, Ronda Grizzle, Jeremy Boggs, Laura Miller, and Shane Lin. And I would also like to express my thanks to Sarah McKee, Lisa Flowers, Anandi Silva Knuppel, and all the ECDS students for making this trip possible and invigorating.
Sarah asked me to give a high-level overview of the Scholars’ Lab and how we work with students. I will do that today, but my standard disclaimer about the Scholars’ Lab is that we are a complex entity with many different folks doing many kinds of jobs. And you will get a different path through our work depending on who you ask. I am the Head of Student Programs, so given my work and interests you might come away from this talk thinking, “they only work with students.” This is not true! We have an R&D team and spatial technologies staff that work with the entire university, students, faculty, and library staff alike on a variety of different projects related to digital scholarship, digital preservation, and digital project development. So what you will hear about today is about my own particular corner of the lab. One of my colleagues might have a different, overlapping story. My story is about our students, though I am happy to help flesh the full picture out for you if you would like during discussion.

At the risk of tipping my hand too early, I wanted to offer an overview of what is to come. I’ll move back and forth between example and theory, but the main takeaways, if I had to offer them are these. First, DH pedagogy does not just take place in the classroom, and it’s not just about DH. Second, digital humanities pedagogy is pedagogy. Third, DH pedagogy at every level should consider, intersect with, and reconstruct desire paths through the academy. I’ll talk more about all of these ideas in a moment. I’m not going to be offering any practical thoughts on how to carry out DH pedagogy, though I’m happy to do so in the discussion afterwards. This is more a talk about the animating philosophy for DH and pedagogy as we try to practice it in the lab, about the idea that teaching can offer spaces for hope in the university.

When Sarah invited me here today, as is usually the case for things like this, she asked me to send her a bio. I always dread this part of giving talks. When I was a student, I always felt like I hadn’t done enough, and I hated hearing people read my short list back to me. Now that I have been working in the field for a bit longer, I still find it embarrassing for different reasons. So I decided to take a cue from Chad Sansing of the Mozilla Foundation and do something with this moment of discomfort. In his bio on Medium he mentions, a bit tongue in cheek, “I teach for the users.”

I don’t want to spend my entire time here reiterating the plot of the 1982 movie Tron, but, in my reading at least, Sansing’s bio is a riff on a line from that movie: “he fights for the users.” The line describes the titular character of the movie, a security program who fights other fascist computer programs on behalf of the users who have been locked out of the computing world. It’s a lot. But I like Sansing’s adoption of it here, and I wanted to try it out for myself. I like the way that his bio ties up his identity into a kind of mission statement. “Who am I” becomes “why am I here?” He is here to teach, and he’s here to teach the users how to take back control of the web.
The bio I gave Sarah ended with the phrase “he works for the students.” That phrase is a mission statement and also the subject of this talk, which will deal with how we work in the Scholars’ Lab to have care and consideration towards our student collaborators suffuse everything we do. I’ll talk against the ideas that teaching only takes place in the classroom and that administrative work has nothing to do with teaching.  I’ll start with what we do in the lab “for the students” and why. Second, I’ll contextualize this briefly as happening against the backdrop of a larger crisis in higher education. Third, I’ll offer thoughts about how we can shape a DH pedagogy that responds to such emergencies.

To begin. In the Scholars’ Lab, we try to start by approaching the whole student. We try to think about how our decisions affect lives and need to be informed by lives. Because administrative choices matter in big ways for people. When an application date gets set, who is eligible for a fellowship, or what kinds of work we allow as permissible in a particular context - choices like these affect the journeys our students are on.
So I would like to start by talking about paths. This image by an English Councillor circulated on the Digital Pedagogy Lab hashtag last month, and it illustrates a phenomenon called a “desire path” or a “desire line” – I would wager we have all seen them before. Desire lines are the paths made, over time, by people stepping on the same, unplanned path. They typically represent the organic actions of pedestrians as opposed to what was planned by the city designer. In this case, based on the Twitter conversation, the path you’re looking at appears to have been made over time by cyclists in response to the constructions you see on the left, obstacles deliberately put in place to discourage cyclists speeding along on this paved path. It is not difficult to imagine the accessibility issues caused by this same construction choice.
I’m taken with this image as a metaphor for the life of a graduate student in academia (caveat here that most of my comments will be about graduate students given who I tend to work with, but I think they are relevant for students generally as well). The image certainly resonates with me, coming as I do to work in the library without a library professional degree but instead with a PhD in English. In short, our students might get into this space for one reason, and we might imagine paths through it on their behalf. But everyone finds their own way through their own education and often through different means and to different ends than we anticipate. I certainly got pulled sideways at a certain point and wound up in a place I could not have envisioned at the beginning of my time at UVA.
I often wonder in related ways about my own activities in the administration of the Scholars’ Lab and in higher education more generally. In my role, I’m often making or offering small choices that are likely to affect the course of someone’s journey through their time as a student. These individual, local interventions in a person’s path - how do they fit into the larger journey for them? Am I helping people to form their own desire paths? Or am I the one throwing up barriers? How can I take those barriers down or help pave a new path to help the route be a little easier? Who am I to be making such decisions for other people? How can I take the responsibility of these choices as seriously as possible?
Given this logic of the desire path, for student programs to service your community in a perfect world you will be offering a diverse slate of opportunities. Because your student population does not just have broad and diverse disciplinary research questions – they also come from a range of different backgrounds and life situations. An MA student, at UVA at least, has a different course load and does not typically teach. This puts them in a fundamentally different category financially, with different pressures and needs, from a PhD student. And what works for one will not work for the other. That is to say, any conversation about DH pedagogy, for me, starts and ends with a discussion of the lived circumstances of the students. Our student activities in the lab are foremost informed by a consideration for the diverse contexts and backgrounds that our students represent.

We try to make our programs fit those many needs, and we try to offer a number of different ways in to do so. The phrase “for the students” that I mentioned earlier is also pretty close to a page on our website where I try to collect everything that a student might be interested in knowing about us. This is the “For Students” page of the Scholars’ Lab website if you would like to check it out at scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/for-students. I will talk about a few of these pieces in detail first from a nuts and bolts standpoint and then a theoretical one, though I am happy to talk in more depth about any one of them.

We regularly offer two hourly wage positions for students in the lab. The first is that we employ hourly students in our makerspace as technologists assisting community members with 3D printing jobs, experimental electronics, or sewing and wearable electronics. No experience is necessary for a student to take on the role, and we typically train people up on the job. There are a number of makerspaces on campus, but ours is distinct for being committed to teaching folks how to do the printing themselves. So you don’t drop off a file and pick up a print - you learn how the technologies work. And our makerspace primarily caters to humanities students, though we do get a fair amount of traffic from science students who tend to find our space less crowded than the ones provided by the Engineering School.

Second, our GIS specialists Drew McQueen and Chris Gist service needs related to spatial technologies for the entire University, and they regularly employ a GIS student collaborator to assist them in doing so. This student and these projects can come from across the university – not just the humanities. And they also frequently collaborate with local and regional governmental organizations on a variety of different geospatial projects. Our students are there at each step along the way as collaborators.

We also engage students in an internship for course credit through the architecture school, where our 3D Technologies Specialist, Will Rourk, collaborates with them on the scanning of artifacts and spaces that are significant for cultural heritage purposes. They often carry out site visits in the region, and Will also collaborates with local museums on scanning objects of importance to them.

Will then engages those same students in the production of 3D data based on these objects. Through the process, our student interns get a deep introduction to all different parts of a 3D data pipeline, and the work that they all do together is truly impressive. The previous tweet and this 3D model all relate to the McCormick observatory on UVA’s campus.

Beyond these opportunities, we also offer two yearlong fellowship programs that offer deeper dives into digital humanities. These are the programs that I most directly supervise. Our higher-level DH fellowship is for advanced PhD students at the dissertation stage who want to work on a project related to their research. They teach some, but they are largely doing a deep dive into developing a professional portfolio that will serve them on the job market. And our Praxis Program is something of an introduction to digital humanities by way of project-based pedagogy. The six students in this fellowship each year form a cohort and work collaboratively on a self-designed project over the course of two semesters. The students drive the program: the fall feels more like a seminar or workshop with us at the front of the room, but the spring is owned by them. We flick them in a direction, but they take the project and develop it in a way that feels authentically theirs both in spirit, scope, and shape.
So that’s a piece of what we do in the lab, and you might have noticed just how much we do for students. I am well aware that the Scholars’ Lab is in a privileged position as far as resources go, both for centers for digital research and even within our own library. Over 2/3 of our budget goes directly to students, and we work directly with about 50 students each year. That’s a lot. As anyone who works with budgets knows, our own budget is the result of longstanding and ongoing campaigns for more resources. I am grateful for allies in the library who recognize the value of supporting students and especially to those who fought for years before I was involved to get those numbers to where they are. These numbers are not settled, and we have to work to keep them every year. But I bring these points up to ask - what can an institution without this level of support do? What can an individual without the support of an institution do? What are small actions we can take in our pedagogy - particularly our DH pedagogy - to help the desire paths our students are trying to make for themselves, even when we’re limited by resource scarcity?

For me, one way of approaching these questions is to think more deeply about what we mean when we think of pedagogy. I remember one conversation I had about teaching, when a colleague offhandedly said, “Oh well I don’t teach.” And a nearby colleague agreed as well. I remember doing a double take. These were people who, to my mind, were constantly engaged in the work of teaching.

Even besides the workshops they regularly give, these were people who mentored students, helped with their projects, and pair programmed beside them to help them learn. Furthermore, they’re fantastic teachers. The general culture in the Scholars’ Lab is one in which we constantly engage in peer mentoring. Digital Humanities is hard - there are so many fields. No one knows all of it, and we try to offer a spirit of generous assistance to each other every day as we find our way through this field. How, then, did I have an entirely different view of these colleagues than they did of their own work?
I think my colleagues were equating teaching with teaching classes as instructors of record. And, to be fair, sometimes I’m asked whether I am teaching or not in the upcoming semester, and I don’t quite know how to respond either. While I sometimes teach semester-long courses, my primary work is not in such traditional modes of instruction. While it’s not really the question they’re asking, my gut response is usually to think, “when am I not teaching?”

This is to say that pedagogy is not something that only happens in the classroom. I especially like the way that Sean Michael Morris describes this notion in an interview with Jesse Stommel. They’re two prominent scholar-practitioners of critical digital pedagogy, and they’re the chief instigators behind Digital Pedagogy Lab. In an interview about their new collection An Urgency of Teachers, Morris describes pedagogy as not something we just enact in the classroom. Instead, it’s a system of beliefs that we carry with us. A way of orienting ourselves in the world. Or at least it should be. If we think about teaching and pedagogy as things that only take place when we’re in front of a classroom or with our names in an LMS, then I would argue that we’re not thinking of teaching in the fullest possible sense. The spaces for teaching are vast, and our students many. To be “for the students,” we need to think of education as a way of life. As something that runs deeper than sharing material with students. This about how we view them and their work. We’re always teaching, whether or not we’re in front of students for a whole semester.

It’s one thing to believe having values like these are important. But in the Lab we also believe it’s important to share them, and now we’re getting into the philosophy behind what we do. We believe it is important to write our work philosophies down and to explicitly say them in public. In the Scholars’ Lab, we believe in explicit statements of values called charters, documents that spell out your beliefs, goals, and ambitions. We have had our cohorts of Praxis students put charters together describing their shared ambitions and values each year for the last nine years. Here you have one of the Praxis charters from one of the early cohorts. They cite free and generous credit, transparency, and an awareness of each other’s diverse backgrounds and disciplinary interests as important markers for them. The hope is that by encouraging our students to examine their shared group identity we will draw out a richer sense of themselves and each other.
Last year in conversation with Jeremy Boggs we realized that, even though we have our students write a charter every year, we hadn’t actually done one of our own, as a staff, for our student programs. We possessed a general charter for the lab, but we thought our student programs needed to explicitly share their own pedagogical philosophy and promises. It was time to make things clear and explicit. So we wrote one together. For the students.

You can find the whole charter on our website at scholarslab.org/student-programs-charter, and I’d encourage you to read it. It’s a document that is not perfect, but it’s one that I’m glad is out in the world. Here are a few excerpts from it that describe our approach to teaching.

We’re here, and we care. We trust in students. We teach the whole person. We’re committed to advancing pedagogical practices that are equitable, just, and ethical. It’s important that our students know where we stand, and one of the first things I have our students do is read this document along with the more general charter for the Scholars’ Lab. Our pedagogies, the ways we think about our work with students, should be shared with them. In the Lab we believe they should be part of the conversation.
Lest you think this is an artifact of the quotes I chose to emphasize, the charter doesn’t actually talk an awful lot about technology. It does occasionally, but only in oblique ways. We want our students to own their projects as well as their domains. We want them to fail in public in a way that pushes their comfort zone but not their safety. We all feel like imposters - many of us everyday. Some of you probably feel like imposters right now. I know I do. These points imply a certain interdisciplinary approach to technology, even though they are not specific to digital humanities.
And it’s also not lost on me that I’ve spent most of this talk on digital humanities pedagogy not talking all that much about digital humanities pedagogy. And that’s part of the point.

Digital humanities pedagogy is pedagogy. I’ll say that again. Digital humanities pedagogy is pedagogy. Similarly, to go back to Digital Pedagogy Lab, I’ve heard Sean Michael Morris say that the “digital” part of DPL is just an excuse to get people in the room to talk about pedagogy. The definition of digital humanities I usually give to students is one I draw from Elizabeth Grumbach: DH is asking humanities questions of technology and asking humanities questions with technology. DH pedagogy is certainly teaching that engages with those topics, materials, and methods, but leaving it there is akin to saying that you only teach if you’re an instructor of record.
Because I feel a tad guilty staying wholly theoretical I want to pause for a moment to say that there are great resources for digital humanities pedagogy from a practical perspective: I highly recommend Using Digital Humanities in the Classroom, co-authored by Claire Battershill and Shawna Ross, and Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, edited by Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers. These resources are exemplary for those seeking practical advice and examples on how to teach digital humanities.
But what I mean by “DH pedagogy is pedagogy” is that, for us in the Scholars’ Lab, a digital humanities pedagogy is one that thinks deeply and critically about the teaching itself and the interpersonal, societal, and institutional changes it purports to make. It’s not just about the classroom. That is to say, we certainly teach DH methods, tools, and thinking, but we’re more directly trying to think about how and why we do this work and what larger implications it might have. Digital humanities might be an especially good opportunity to make these sorts of interventions, and that brings me to the quote that the title of this talk is riffing on.

“Opportunities for Hope” is a play on Henry Giroux quoting the work of Paulo Freire. In full it reads: “Hope demanded an anchoring in transformative practices, and one of the tasks of the progressive educator was to ‘unveil opportunities for hope, no matter what the obstacles may be.’” For Freire, education in its best shape was always about social reform, and he called for new forms of teaching that empowered students and upended traditional modes of instruction like the banking model for education that assumes students are empty vessels who need to have the knowledge of the instructor given to them only to regurgitate it back. And it’s this same spirit of transformation that we bring to the students who work with us in the Scholars’ Lab. How can our pedagogical practices as digital humanists open up space for new ideas for students, but more importantly, for imagining new lives? How can we unveil opportunities for hope, no matter the difficulties? Beyond simply giving them tools and methods, how can we go further and make the teaching we do be a political intervention?

More specifically, how do we unveil opportunities for hope in a climate like the one in which we all live, where it often feels higher education is on fire? Tenure track positions are vanishing, adjunctification is on the rise, and an enormous number of students and staff are in precarious positions. A so-called “free speech” crisis threatens actual free expression and freethinking in our classrooms. I could go on and on. I spoke about the privileged position the Scholars’ Lab is in, in terms of funding. But, no matter how much funding we’re able to direct to students, it’s never enough. There are always more students applying for fellowships than we have spots to give. Since I’ve been teaching, students have spoken with me about homelessness, food insecurity, precarious finances, uncertain job futures, mental health crises, chronic health conditions, and more. And I know the student populations I’ve worked with are not unique in higher education. How do we find hope for ourselves and for our students in the face of these situations? And what can pedagogy do here? I’ll offer three provisional responses to this question. In the face of a crisis in higher education, we should think of the work we do as creating spaces of shelter and intervention, as empowering student voices, and as changing culture more broadly.

My first response is that we can think of the teaching work that we do in digital humanities spaces as work that seeks to shelter and also to intervene. “What is a feminist lab?” was a symposium that took place at University of Colorado Boulder earlier this year. I got permission from Jacqueline Wernimont to cite her remarks, quoted here: “A lab can be a technology to survive the institutions we work in while we seek to transform them.” Our students in the Scholars’ Lab frequently refer to it as an oasis in the larger academy, by which I take them to mean that we value their futures, their concerns, and anxieties in ways that are not as well supported elsewhere. As they develop charters and have conversations about the values they want to develop and promote during their time with us, I often encourage them to think of it as an opportunity to shape the sort of kind, generous, and transformative space they want to see in the academy.
That is to say, we also engage students in a wide variety of support that is not particular to wage employment or research. Some of these are programmatic. We offer mock interviews if students wind up applying for library or digital humanities related jobs. We read materials. We circulate job postings relevant to this kind of work. But more generally we have frank conversations with students about our lives and theirs and try to make space for them in ways that might otherwise be difficult in other parts of the university. Our fellowships don’t carry grades, we allow deferment of our fellowships, and we generally try to make lives a little easier. For us, this is the work of pedagogy, and the fact that we are operating in a library-based digital humanities space helps facilitate this. Your own mileage may vary, as your circumstances are likely to be different. Given your own limitations, how can you use your position as teachers to inject more kindness into the academy?

Second – we can respond by asking, “where are the students?”
It’s important that we keep student interests and needs in mind. They are an important audience for our work, but sometimes they can disappear from the conversation when we discuss long-term strategy. So simply asking how students fit in is a place to start, and even small actions like making sure the word “student” appears on mission statements can be important interventions. But we can go further.  Student voices need to be included in discussions about their own education. Digital humanities pedagogy is often quite amenable to this, as project-based pedagogy of the sort that is common in DH can often invite students to have an active role in shaping their experiences. The UCLA Student Collaborator Bill of Rights has other good advice for how to engage student voices and to make sure that you’re doing so in an ethical way. It’s a touchstone for us in the Lab.

The Small Liberal Arts Community (as exemplified by ILiADS) offers fantastic models for how you can engage students as true partners in research projects and disrupt the labor distinctions that all too often exist in our work. I’d encourage you to explore the ILiADS site for examples of projects that might offer models as you think through how to work with students. For my money, the SLAC community is offering some of the most exciting digital pedagogy work. This kind of flattened distinction between student and teacher, as much as possible, is something we try to aim for in the Scholars’ Lab. It’s expressed in a concise way, I think, in this Instagram story by Nicholas Payton, a prominent jazz trumpet player and composer.

In a recent “ask me anything” session on Instagram, Payton was asked, “Who are the best trumpet teachers alive right now?” He responded, “There are no great teachers, only great students who give tools to other students.” That is the world I want to live in. A world in which the Scholars’ Lab students see themselves as experts, and in which their staff and faculty see themselves as equal partners in the pursuit of knowledge.
We’re all students at the end of the day.

This can sometimes feel difficult to square with digital humanities, though, where often we quite literally have things we need to share with students that they are encountering for the first time. One thing we try to do in the Lab, beyond adapting our curriculum to the needs of the students, is talk to our students about the work of teaching and learning in which we are all engaged. We talk to them about why we are doing what we are doing, what difficulties we’re having, and what thoughts they might have for making a better experience.
For example, I mentioned the Praxis Program, our yearlong fellowship where our students go from soup-to-nuts with digital humanities, from knowing little to launching their own collaborative digital project by the end. For years, the interdisciplinary makeup of the team has been a recipe for real interpersonal conflict. Usually in March. Every year, right when the rubber hits the road and they’re trying to launch their project. Finally this past year we decided to talk to the team about it.
During the second session of Praxis this year, Amanda Visconti and I ran a discussion for our new cohort of Praxis students on good collaboration and community. And we laid this pedagogical problem out – we talked about issues we had in the program in the past not as interpersonal issues between specific people but as expressions of larger difficulties in collaborative work. We discussed what seemed to help and what did not. What’s more, we also talked about what good collaboration looked like for each other and how the students could make sure they treated each other with respect and kindness first. The students took the conversation very seriously. Last year was the best year yet as far as collaboration is concerned, and Amanda and I just ran the conversation for a new cohort last week. In short, there’s no need to treat pedagogy like something that has to be hidden from your students. Particularly in DH, as it asks so much of students professionally, interpersonally, and emotionally, we need to involve student voices in the development of good teaching practices. They deserve it, and everyone’s experience will be enriched.
Third, and I think it’s apparent from this talk, we have to think about the work that we do, even at the level of the individual assignment, as engaged in a larger project of shifting the culture of the university. When I spoke to the graduate students earlier today, we ended our workshop by talking about values. The workshop was called “getting from here to there” with a digital project, but the point was that there is always going to be another project. Another semester. Another student. It’s more important to think about why you’re doing this work: what are the animating philosophies behind what you’re doing? I’ve tried to give you a glimpse today of the “why” for the Scholars’ Lab.
I encouraged the students earlier to think about their work as opportunities to open up small spaces for more generous, kind, and productive spaces in the academy, to imagine the future they want to see into the world. In the Lab we see our work as part of a larger attempt to shift the culture of the university, both in terms of what graduate training in the humanities can look like but also in terms of what kinds of conversations are acceptable.

At UVA, we’re plugged into a larger network of like-minded programs working to train graduate students for a broad range of lives and future careers. This program, called PHD+, has been instrumental for us in helping to see that the work we’re doing as being part of a larger movement to rethink what graduate education can look like. Thinkers like Katina Rogers and Cathy Davidson, both at CUNY, and Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel, co-founders of the Digital Pedagogy Lab, have been instrumental for me in seeing the work of the classroom as intimately connected to the work outside it. And, to go back to my point about student voices, we talk about these issues explicitly with our students. We have a session on diverse career options for them, on labor precarity and employment in digital humanities. We’re not solely interested in getting them jobs; we want to make sure that they can find their ways to happy futures no matter the outcome.

So to bring it back to an earlier image and earlier questions - when working on DH pedagogy decisions I’d encourage you to think about this image. I know I will. How are our decisions helping people navigate their own desire paths through the university? Throwing up new barriers for them? Paving new roads? How can we make even small assignments part of larger culture shifts? How might digital humanities pedagogy, in libraries and out of them, make space for these conversations?
That’s my talk. Thanks for listening. I’m happy to talk more about Tron, the Scholars’ Lab, nuts and bolts of digital humanities pedagogy, other opportunities for hope, and anything else you’d like.

We are now accepting applications for the 2020-2021 Digital Humanities Fellowship Cohort.
The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2020-2021 academic year is Monday, November 25th, 2019 at 11:59 PM. We will do our best to render decisions by late December.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials, all of which should be emailed directly to Brandon Walsh:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab and UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;
and a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career.


a Graduate Fellowship Application Form;
a dissertation abstract;
2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation (these letters can be sent in by email to Brandon Walsh);
and your availability for a 30-minute interview slot sometime on Monday, December 9th from 9:00AM-10:00AM, 11:00AM-12:00PM, or 1:30PM-4:00PM. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around the 9th or 10th of December.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well.



Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award. ↩

				Crossposted to my personal blog.
			
		
A few weeks ago, I visited Emory University in conjunction with the launch of their new graduate fellowship for students aiming to incorporate digital projects in their dissertations. This is the first of two posts sharing materials from the two events I took part in while there. I was asked to give a workshop on project development for graduate students as well as an open talk on digital humanities pedagogy. The text of what follows pertains to the workshop for students, where I was asked to give a broad overview of how to approach project planning and some activities for helping them think through their work for the year. I essentially tried to condense the greatest hits of the Praxis Program into 90 minutes. I was asked to give a 30 minute talk and 60 minute workshop, but I’ll get into how we shifted things around below.
First, a few caveats. For one, I write a talk for situations like these, but I try to avoid straight-up reading the text (more info on how I approach public speaking in DH available here). So what you’ll see below is more like a roadmap of the general gist of what we talked about. I don’t remember consulting the text too much in the moment, and I know for a fact that the last few paragraphs were dramatically different in person. Second, and related - since this was meant to be a workshop and not a lecture I planned on a fair amount of discussion with the really thoughtful and engaged students.
All of this is to say that I planned on deviating from my plan, and I tried to represent that below. In the text that follows you’ll find the actual running text of a talk and workshop plan along with notes to you, the reader, marked with [sidebar: brackets] describing how I modified things in the moment to adapt to the group and the conversation as it unfolded. You’ll get a mix of both the script for the presentation and some notes on how I managed things as it diverted from expectations. It might get a little confusing, but I imagine it could be interesting to see how things got restructured and shifted around in the moment.
Planning for a span of time as long as 90 minutes is difficult, so I deliberately planned far more than I could cover in the allotted time just in case. I went into it knowing I’d need to be flexible. If I had to offer any suggestions for workshops in general it would be this - plan more than you need but do not try to rush to make it through your material. Let the conversation and the discussion shape the pace of your teaching, not a need to cover a particular amount of content. I always find it more helpful to do more with less. In this case, it meant that I was watching the clock from the beginning and looking for milestones along the way where, if needed, I could wrap things up.
[Sidebar: we’re in talk land now. What follows is the rough script of the talk and discussion that Anandi Silva Knuppel, Sarah McKee, and I fielded together.]
Getting from Here to There

Hey friends! How is it going? I’m Brandon Walsh, the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab in the UVA Library. The Scholars’ Lab is a center for experimental scholarship informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage thinking. For the purposes of our conversation today, my work with students is probably most relevant. I facilitate a number of different fellowship programs and student opportunities in the lab, where I’m in charge of everything from mundane administrative tasks to more abstract things like constructing our pedagogical mission. And I collaborate with a range of people in the Lab and the Library to carry out different kinds of teaching for our community. I work with students from a range of disciplines, which means I have a fair amount of experience helping people plan, scope, and execute projects. I’ve titled this workshop “Getting from Here to There.”

[First sidebar: Anandi Silva Knuppel was the one who invited me to speak at Emory, and she gave a general orientation to their fellowship program before I started my piece. She included several photos of her children and family in the talk, and I quickly realized that the tone of my section would feel like a weird shift from hers. So, while she was presenting, I threw in a bunch of photos of the cat my partner and I recently adopted. This is Pepper, and he makes numerous appearances in what follows.]

Before we get started, I wanted to offer some resources and gratitude. If you need the text or slides of this talk for any reason, you can find them at the first link here. The second link will take you to a Zotero collection for this talk, so you don’t necessarily need to rapidly write down the links to things as we’re going. I’ve collected them for you. I wanted to credit my colleagues at the Scholars’ Lab, whose work I’ll discuss in what follows. Amanda Visconti, Ronda Grizzle, Jeremy Boggs, Laura Miller, and Shane Lin especially show up in the following slides. And, finally, I wanted to thank Sarah McKee, Lisa Flowers, Anandi Silva Knuppel, and everyone at ECDS and the Fox Center for the Humanities for the invitation to talk here. I’m truly flattered and grateful.

In terms of what we’ll cover today, I’m planning on taking you through a series of questions related to DH project planning roughly organized around questions pertaining to the how, what, who, and why of digital projects. This is my roadmap through the topic, and I’m happy to just lecture at you. But it’d be great to have questions and discussion as relevant and necessary. So please do interrupt. The conversation will be better for your contributions and better for your ideas. Ultimately this is about making it useful for you. So tell me what you need, and I’m happy to go where you want. I won’t necessarily have all the answers, but I’m happy to talk together.
[Sidebar: I had planned on running some icebreakers to get to know the students and their work, but Sarah and Anandi actually did this during their opening orientation for the program. So the slide I had planned on getting to know each other became wholly irrelevant. Instead, I realized that I should share a little bit about my own background as it pertained to the topic at hand. So during Anandi’s orientation I inserted a couple slides about the Lab and myself.]

So I’ve learned a little about you, but who am I? I work in digital humanities now, but I didn’t actually start doing anything with DH until I was a graduate student myself. I didn’t even know of it as a term until I became interested in the fellowships that my friends were doing in the Scholars’ Lab. It took a few years of finding my feet, but the digital project I worked on for my dissertation had to with Virginia Woolf and machine learning, and it was a project that taught me a lot about myself, my work, and what I wanted out of life. So believe me when I say that you are all far more advanced than I was at the same point in my career. You’re doing great! And you are well prepared for the projects you’re working on.
[Sidebar: During Anandi’s orientation, one of the fellows asked a question about how their own program at Emory compared to the larger landscape of digital humanities graduate programs. Was it unique? How did it compare to other fellowships? So I called another audible and inserted the following slide about the Scholars’ Lab programs so that the students could get context for how things might be structured differently. It’s different aesthetically because, well, it’s from a different talk! I copied and pasted it in quickly from the talk I’d be giving at Emory later that evening.]

Based on your question about other graduate programs in DH, I thought it might be worth pausing for just a moment to share what our students do with us in the Scholars’ Lab. At the Lab, we have two year-long fellowship programs. The Praxis Program is something of a soup to nuts introduction to digital humanities for students early in their graduate career. These students typically come in without much experience in digital technologies, but the goal for us over the course of a year is to get them in a position for them to launch their own collaborative digital project. The second fellowship listed here is our year-long Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities, a program for people with more experience and who are working to tie DH to their dissertation projects in some way. These students work with a point of contact on our R&D team for the year to develop their project, and students in both programs give public presentations by the end of the year. If you’re interested in learning more, I’m happy to talk at greater length about our individual programs. The Praxis Network might also be a useful resource - it’s a website that archives snapshots of several like-minded programs at one point in time, so on that project you get glimpses at several different approaches to graduate education.

Let’s get started. I titled this talk “Getting from here to there” because, to me, that’s the most difficult thing about planning any project. And this is particularly true for a student digital humanities project. I like this image because the alt text for it, the text meant to describe its contents for accessibility purposes, is “man standing in hallway.” It showed up when I did a search on Unsplash for “future.” I don’t know about you, but I have a hard time seeing a person in that photo. And when you’re starting out with any kind of digital project that’s part of the challenge. How do you get from point A to point B? How do you get your project from here to there? And how do you place yourself within it?

Now I’m just trying to show you snazzy images, but starting a digital project often puts me in this position. I feel like I’m learning to walk for the first time, and each step seems insurmountable. Each step brings new anxieties, and I’d like to know more about yours. I learned a little about your work, but I’d like to know a little more about your questions. What is the single biggest question you have right now about getting started? What is your single biggest anxiety about the year to come?
[Sidebar: I had budgeted a little time to have the students discuss concerns, but we wound up talking for longer than I anticipated (it turns out I really wanted to help them work through things). At this point, because we had started the workshop a tad late after lunch, I was already becoming aware that we were going to run out of time. We were only about 15 minutes into the 90-minute session, but I had already changed my sense of the timeline for the talk. The questions the students asked were very good. So good, that it seemed as though they were plants. They talked broadly about concerns that they might not have meaningful contributions to make to the field more broadly at this stage in their work, anxieties about finding their way into the DH community, questions about professionalization, and more. Sarah and I fielded them together. The questions worked well as a transition, because I correctly anticipated that some of them would feel like imposters.]
Those are all excellent questions. And part of the message I want you to take away today is that questions like that are all normal. It is normal not to know the answers. Behind all of your questions I heard implied another, particular anxiety.

[Sidebar: insert joke about Pepper looking stressed while working.]

Behind your concerns, really at their core, I heard questions about imposterdom. When am I going to be exposed for the fraud that I am? I have no idea what I’m doing – when am I going to be found out? I am here to tell you today that almost everyone feels this way. And if you don’t – you’re a Dunning-Kruger, as this chart explains. This feeling – imposter syndrome – is something we live with all through our lives. I’m feeling it right now! And I think it shows that you’re a good, thoughtful, reflective, well-meaning person. This article by Tanya X. Short has some excellent strategies for working through your feelings of imposterdom. I recommend it. But I also recommend you take a deep breath, close your eyes, and recognize that you belong here. You can do this project, and you have a community of people here to help you. I’m also happy to help in any way I can if you want to reach out after this event. But more practically, there are some helpful resources and methods I can share with you for how you can get started. Because one way you can address imposter syndrome is by doing what you always do as academics. Do research. Prepare. Use the resources available to you. The process for digital work does have key differences that I can help you think through. But it is not so wholly alien and different as it might seem at first glance. I have a series of questions that I usually talk through with newcomers to digital projects as they’re thinking for the first time about this kind of work, and I’ll be giving you a version of that conversation today.
Reminder: interrupt me at any time. To begin.

How will you go about your work? On a day-to-day basis, what is the process by which you will carry out your work? You might be getting to the point where you have good,  personal project management styles that work for you as you’re writing your dissertation. If you don’t, now is a good time to develop them. But it can always be helpful to hear about other strategies. Know thyself in the first instance – find what works for you and stick to it. But don’t be afraid to try out something new.

Who here has heard of Trello? We don’t explicitly use this tool in the Scholars’ Lab as a whole staff, but we use it on the technical board for one of the journals I’m involved with – the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. It’s pretty simple - the idea is that each task gets a card associated with it that you can comment on and move around. Nothing too earth shattering here, but these task management systems become increasingly important as your projects grow in complexity and as you begin to work with collaborators. They’re especially good for humanities projects, in particular, because we’re not used to thinking in terms like this. How do you take a complicated humanities problem and break it into smaller, completable steps? Doing this with technical work can help keep you from burning out and help you feel that you’re moving forward. It can make the whole process of getting from here to there feel doable. You’ll likely be bad at it at first and have trouble with task managing. That’s OK! It’s a skill you can develop like anything else.

If you’ve ever talked to anyone else about the way that they work, you’ve probably realized that everyone takes on projects in different ways. Even writing. When I was writing my dissertation, I would use the “add comment” feature in Microsoft Word to leave myself tasks on the document itself. Any page would have hundreds of comments that I would sort through when I sat down to write and was looking for where to begin for the day. I would be shocked if anyone else used this weird, idiosyncratic system of mine.
Digital work is no different - we all have different ways of going about it. But it’s helpful to get everyone working from the same book if not exactly on the same page. In a corporate context, it can save time, money, and energy if your team has a shared philosophy towards your workflow and project management. This can be true of humanities and DH work as well. In the Scholars’ Lab, we use an approach to project management called Agile Development. The basics of it are before you in this diagram. The general idea is that you work in two-week sprints (at least in the way that I implement it with our students). At the end of each sprint you reflect on where you’re at, what you need help with, and what you need for next steps. A scrum is a term taken from rugby, and it is a set of tools and methodologies for conducting these of check-ins, whether they happen daily or at the end of your sprints. In our staff scrums, for example, we go around the room and ask for two-minute updates (max) describing what you are currently working on, what is next for you, and what you are not working on. But for your purposes here today, you can just think of it as a two-week sprint followed by a meeting to touch base. And then you repeat. We do this with our fellows, who have biweekly scrums with their R&D points of contact.
That explains the center of the diagram. The left side of it refers, I believe, to the idea that you should break your larger project down into smaller tasks that you can accomplish in two-week sprints. That way you have a good sense of progress. In a student project situation, this might be as simple as “I’m going to work through this chapter from this programming book and come to you with the progress I’ve made and the questions I have.” And if a task can’t be accomplished in two weeks it’s probably actually several smaller tasks lumped into one. Break your tasks down until you find something you can do in that window of time. One last thing here – notice the emphasis on circular shapes and the word “potentially.” One of the core concepts of agile development is the idea that iteration is good. It actually saves you time, energy, and, in the corporate world, money to produce something early that might be half baked and get feedback on it. This allows you to learn from your mistakes and iterate on your materials. It requires a certain amount of humility to work like this, and it’s radically different from what we’re used to in academia. Produce something for other eyes? Before it’s perfect? Perish the thought.

But truly – I’m here to tell you that perfectionism, while often encouraged in academia, can be a significant barrier to getting things done (and hint – also a cause of imposter syndrome). The Cult of Done Manifesto is a document I adore that gets at this point. “Accept that everything is a draft,” it reads. Your project is a draft. You’re a draft! It helps to think about ourselves as works in progress. The Cult of Done Manifesto isn’t a text that necessarily comes from the agile community per se, but they have overlapping concerns. Iteration is a part of our practice. It’s how we learn.
It’s worth considering that not everyone is equally able to iterate or develop in public – women, people of color, and other marginalized communities have different experiences of the world and of digital life. And the internet, the public audience for much digital work, is toxic. But it’s worth at least thinking about how you can push yourself to rethink the practices with which you’re comfortable in spaces that allow you to do so. I’m not really talking about a binary, where, on the one hand, things are kept fully private until they are absolutely perfect and, on the other, you’re publishing every piece of half-finished work for all to see. Find what makes sense to you. Consider how you can take small steps that work for you in the direction of being more comfortable with your work in progress as something worth sharing.

One last note on agile. The agile community released a series of principles that are worth pausing over. I’ll read them. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan. Keep in mind that these come from the software world. Let’s take a moment to think about them. What do you notice about them? How might these apply to your own work as a humanities student? As a DH student? What are they missing?
[Sidebar: At this point I paused for discussion and questions. My goal was to get the students to think about questions of communication, self-reflection, and iteration as they might pertain to their own work. The students had great thoughts and questions about how to apply agile thinking to digital projects and dissertations. One that stuck out to me - how could you apply these sorts of ideas to a project where you were, really, the sole person working on the project? I suggested in response that, first, you could project manage yourself in the same way you would a team and that, second, projects were almost always the product of many hands, even if they might appear to be the work of a solo individual. Think deeply about the help you might be overlooking and how you can better structure those relationships.]

Lists of principles like this are often helpful, so here is my own spin on the conversation. If I had to offer four principles for DH project planning, I might offer these. Give yourself permission to keep it small. Work iteratively. Credit generously. Connect it to you. There could be many others, and I might give you a different list depending on the day of the week. But they’re a start. We’ll talk more about what some of these points mean shortly.

Everything we’ve talked about so far could be filed under the question of how you’ll do your work. But, at this early stage, you’re probably also thinking about - obsessing about - the what. What exactly do I want to do with this project? One project management tip: this can be a dangerous question. For humanities students and faculty, it’s all too common to want your idea to go deeper, further, more complex. You’re trained to deconstruct and push ideas. This is great when writing a book or teaching a class. But in a digital project each of these potential ideas represents time and energy on your part. Digital projects aren’t developed at the speed of an idea or the speed of writing. They take time to implement. And each new idea takes more time.
Instead, I want to suggest you think about a related question as enlivening.

Instead of asking, “what do I want to do?” you might ask, “what don’t I want to do?” It’s a powerful question. But it is very, very hard to ask it of yourself. And it’s a question whose value only becomes clear with experience. You learn the value of it the hard way. Put another way - check out this image.

Feature creep refers to a tendency for projects to creep along, growing in size, way beyond their original intention. And at a certain point, like this tool here, a project becomes unwieldy and useless. You can’t even pick it up without stabbing yourself. We’ve all worked with tools or interfaces like this – so many options that you can’t do anything at all. When you continue to layer more and more ideas, more and more features, onto a project, things can quickly spin out of control.
This is an especially difficult problem for students of digital humanities because they’re often coming to these questions for the first time. So you don’t know if an idea is a reasonable one or totally impossible. Spoiler alert - this a problem even among professionals. We’re all dealing with this all the time. So I wanted to give you a few ways to think about scoping out features.

[Sidebar: I believe I made a joke here about Pepper’s reaction to feature creep.]

I wanted to share two quotes from a conversation we had about project scoping during my time as a student in the Scholars’ Lab. Apologies if I don’t get the exact wording right - this was a decade ago after all. Here is Wayne Graham, former Head of R&D in the Scholars’ Lab, discussing how he plans out work on a project. He takes any estimate his staff gives him and multiplies by pi, because things always take longer than anticipated, even for professionals.
Now, here is a quote from Bethany Nowviskie, former Head of the Scholars’ Lab and Wayne’s boss.

“I take whatever estimate Wayne gives me and double it.” It was a conversation that really stuck with me. Multiply any estimate for how long a project or task will take by two pi. That’s a lot longer than expected!
How, then, can you decide what’s worth doing? In the face of these kinds of difficulties, it’s helpful to have some sort of a system in place for determining the value of what you’re thinking about doing. This is especially helpful in humanities work, where sometimes the features we’re talking about directly build upon our own ideas about things we care about. It can all feel very personal. It can be helpful to try to make things objective. Here’s one way to do so.

Here’s a checklist for you as you go about your work. Is this feature hard? And is it important? These questions are difficult to answer when starting out, so it can be good to ask for help as you think through them. But it’s also a skill that you can develop with experience. So take the time to try to break your large project into as many components as possible.
Let’s practice together. Take the idea of a digital archive. That’s a big thing. But you could poke at a lot of pieces of it. Say…you were going to make an archive of American protest. What are some decisions you would have to make about it? What would some features be?

[Sidebar: had we more time, at this point I would have paused to actually run the speculative exercise for designing a digital archive, something I’ve done in courses before. I was watching the clock, though, and felt I needed to just give a few conceptual takeaways before moving on. I asked the students to consider a range of different questions that would impact the features and scale of such an archive. Will the archive be private or public? Will it index everything about the topic from all countries in all years? Maybe just one year? Maybe just one country? All types of media? Maybe just text? Will people be able to add to it? If they can add to it, will you have to moderate their contributions? The answers to all of these questions will affect the scale of a project and the time it will take to implement.]
You quickly begin to see that there are many different ways you can slice up a big idea. And any one of these decisions could potentially blow your project up and make it unwieldy. Start small, and, remember – a project that is all things for all people is probably nothing for no one.

That checklist I gave you before is actually a pretty common one, and this visualization probably seems like common sense. But I still think it’s powerful to see laid out like this. Take a moment to look at it. [Sidebar: pause for a moment] Where do you think you want to live? [Sidebar: the answer is top left] Where do you want to avoid? [Sidebar: the answer is bottom right.] And of course you will probably spend most of your time in the top right. Not too difficult to tell that because this visualization gives you helpful names for each category.
This sort of task-oriented thinking isn’t something we’re used to doing. But it’s helpful to think about your work this way. Even something as abstract as writing can benefit from this! In my own situation – I’m a full-time, 12-month, 40-hour staff person, but I still try to write, publish, and (as you can see) give talks. Trying to finish writing projects when you have the regular standing commitments of a job is difficult. I only have so many hours in the workweek. Methods like these help me to figure out how long I have to write, what I can accomplish, and what I can’t.
[Sidebar: I want to give huge credit to Ronda Grizzle here for everything she does for the Lab related to project management. Everything I know about it I learned from her. Anandi also had wonderful thoughts on project management during this portion of the workshop, and she shared them with the students.]

One last quote on this that I want to leave you with. “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” Saying no is a super power. Truly. I’ve said in the Scholars’ Lab before that the best projects – the best features – are the ones you don’t implement. Because saying no to something in the short-term means that, in the long-term, you can say yes to something you really want to do.

[Sidebar: I set aside time here, again, for any questions or discussion that might come up.]
The next question is a big one for students. What kind of support do you have? It’s one thing to talk about the difficulties of project development in theory, but it’s another to come up against the actual realities of project development. You all have lives. You have programs you’re trying to do. This is hard. But the good news is that you’re not alone.

[Sidebar: Pepper being supported, cats, etc. etc. It was also about this time that Sarah and I agreed we would not get to the follow-up activities I had planned. Instead, the new plan was to finish out the talk portion, discuss with the students, and describe the kinds of activities we would have done with more time so that they could follow up with them on their own later. This revised plan meant that I didn’t feel the need to rush through the material - I could instead allow the students space for discussion as they wished.]

For one, I wanted to point you a blog post put out by the MLA Committee on Information Technology on how to begin thinking about putting together a digital dissertation. There are a number of good resources linked here that I would encourage you to check out. Guidelines for evaluating digital work. Models of work that has already been done. Any difficulties you might face from the standpoints of project development, of getting buy-in from your committee, or of dealing with the university have probably been faced by others before you. It is highly unlikely you are the first ones to have these issues. So look for evidence, help, support, and resources from the larger community. I’m happy to help you find things as well. Feel free to reach out.

I’m also certain there are people locally – students, staff, librarians, and faculty – who are in your corner. Sarah has already told me about some of them, and you already mentioned others in your introductions. Accept their help - you don’t have to do this alone. But be careful you don’t take exploit their goodwill.
Instead, I would encourage you to think of this work as an opportunity to start to develop a space more like what you would want the academy to be. This is an image of the Collaborators Bill of Rights. Digital work takes many hands. Consider that labor. Share generously. Credit liberally. Make sure that everyone all the way down is acknowledged in your project, in as many places as you can. Consider how you can make these people your true collaborators if they are up for it – ask them how they want to be cited. If their voice and work are important to you and your project, ask them if they want to co-present or co-author with you. These things might seem weird, trained as we are in the humanities to think of authorship as something done by sole individuals, but that doesn’t have to be the norm. And I can assure you that these conversations mean the world to people in libraries.
This conversation is not just about projects. It’s about people. And you can use this space to begin to help shape a more expansive, generous, and humane way of doing digital work. In the Scholars’ Lab, for example, we push for real collaborations. We do work with – not for – as much as we can. So begin to think about how your project, in some small way, can begin to flatten the hierarchies at work in the academy. If you were interested in a related document about rights you should expect of collaborations as a student, I’d also point you to the Student Collaborators Bill of Rights from UCLA.
[Sidebar: I paused again for questions.]

One tool we use in the Scholars’ Lab to help structure relationships in positive, ethical ways is called a charter. The charter is the last concept that I wanted to introduce to you all. It’s a pretty simple idea – a charter is a document that reflects your shared values and principles. What you expect of each other, how you’re going to work together. What you hope to get out of the thing. Think of it like a personal and collective mission statement.
A charter is something that a group can return to later when questions come up. Articulating values like this can be really useful because when the rubber hits the road you can ask of any new feature, project, or idea - does this connect with the things I care about? Is it advancing our mission, or at least our mission as we want to see it? In front of you is the charter for our first Praxis cohort. We’ve had students on this collaborative fellowship put a charter together every year, and we have several for the lab as well – one for the lab in general and another for how we approach student programs.
The reason I end with the charter is that it connects to what I might offer as a last principle for project planning.

A project is only as good as it connects to you. But you have to decide what that connection looks like.
We encourage our students to think about charters as an opportunity to articulate their project goals and also their goals for their own portion of the project. Their goals for themselves. What do they hope to gain? How do they hope to grow? What do they acknowledge as their own limitations? A project should, in some way, help you in your life. It’s going to get you to a place you want to be, be that professionally, spiritually, intellectually, or ethically. I thought of my dissertation as a story that I wanted to sit with and a story I wanted to tell for a few years. This is similar to how my colleague Jeremy Boggs describes digital archives and digital projects more generally. To him, projects tell stories. Put another way, how is your project going to help you tell yours? Or more specifically – what kind of person do you want to be? How can the telling of your project’s story help you to bring that person into reality? One answer might be as simple as “this content is important to me.” Another could be “I want to become closely connected with the librarians I work with and learn about their lives.” It could mean that you’re aware of the climate of the academic job market, and you’re using this as an opportunity to develop skills and expertise that can help you in a wide variety of careers.
A project is more than just the stuff - the disciplinary material - in it. It’s a statement about how you view your work and the world and how you think each should be. That’s why there’s a blank line at the end here. You have to decide what that last line is for yourself.

To tip my own hand a little bit, I wanted to speak just for a moment about how I see my pedagogical work and the project underlying it. I had this quote by Paulo Freire in mind as I was writing this talk. “As beings programmed for learning and who need tomorrow as fish need water, men and women become robbed beings if they are denied their conditions of participants in the production of tomorrow.” Sean Michael Morris shared this quote with us at Digital Pedagogy Lab a few weeks ago, and it’s been on my mind ever since.  There is a lot there, but Freire is getting at a few things. For Freire, education should always be a radical act of revolution. Students should always be thoroughly engaged in the process of shaping their own learning experiences, and it is the job of the progressive educator to help them overturn traditional modes of education and allow them to act as teachers themselves. The quote is about what does or does not help students produce their own tomorrows, but it’s also about producing the tomorrows of education and society.
I try to approach all the projects I work on – and really the students are the projects – with a sense of this animating philosophy in mind. I always want to ask, “how is what I’m doing here empowering students to reshape the structures that are holding them back?” There can and should be a reason for everything that I do, and I’m constantly thinking about what that reason is.
That’s where I’m coming from. That’s how I fill in that empty line. And I want you to think about that why question for yourselves. It’s not just a why for the content. But also about the why behind all the steps of project planning. How can your work help engineer the tomorrow you want to see?
So I want to end today by helping each of you engage in some soul searching. With the time we have remaining, we’re going to run a series of exercises and discussions about the kinds of goals and assumptions you’re bringing to this. And we’ll talk things out – I’m happy to spend more time addressing specific questions as well. We can go anywhere you want. Let’s get started.
[Sidebar: as I mentioned above, we didn’t actually have time to run the workshop proper, and we instead used the remaining moments for more discussion. I shared the slides with the folks who invited me, because they thought they might make for useful follow-up activities throughout the year. So even though we didn’t get to them, I thought I’d share the materials below with a few quick notes on what I had in mind. I’ll quit with the brackets, as the talk proper has ended. What follows is all just framing for the extra material I had prepared.]
Workshop Activities to Get You There
The preceding talk and discussion aimed to get the students thinking about their projects from a number of different angles - practical, logistical, collaborative, and theoretical. But I ended with values because, to me, they’re the most important. They can also be the most difficult to think about. It takes practice to learn how to articulate your values and goals in relation to a project, a measure of self-reflection that we aren’t necessarily taught how to do in graduate school. The following activities are meant to build on each other and guide participants towards a firmer sense of themselves in relation to their projects.
I also want to explicitly note the importance of the work of two people to the shape of these activities. Ronda Grizzle is the expert in the Lab on project management, charters, and life design, and I adapted the mind mapping activity, in particular, from work she has had us do internally. Secondly, I attended Digital Pedagogy Lab over the summer, and Sean Michael Morris’s breakout session on writing about teaching was instrumental in changing how I thought about in-class writing activities. I learned the four rules for writing from him in that session.
There are three activities I had planned. Given the title of the talk, I suppose I might call them “three activities to get you there”:

Charter discussion
Mind mapping
Timed writing on values

I’ll contextualize each activity briefly and share the slides that I had prepped. Hopefully that will give a sense of how I’d run them if others are interested.
Charter Discussion
Charters can be somewhat difficult to wrap your head around without models. So I planned to begin by offering the students some examples drawn from past years of the Praxis program. I shared the link for praxis.scholarslab.org/charter with the students, and from there I planned on doing a pretty typical think-pair-share activity. None of the charters are especially long, and it’s not necessary to read through one in its entirety to get the flavor of the piece. I anticipated having each student pick a charter to spend five minutes reading and thinking about. After the initial thinking time, they would spend five minutes discussing with their neighbor before we came back for a general discussion for ten minutes or so. The goal was to give the students models and to show them the kinds of categories that might go into such a document. Hopefully from there they would start thinking about personal, professional, and technical values they might have alongside their goals for the year.
The relevant slide:

Mind Mapping
After looking at charters from other groups, the students are ready to start thinking more deeply about their own views on things. For that, I turn to mind mapping.
Mind mapping is an activity that asks people to free associate words related to a particular topic in in the service of opening up a free, non-judgmental space for brainstorming. The first challenge with mind mapping, I find, is that people don’t necessarily know what it is. So several of the following slides focus on setting up the concept for participants.


The definition and example mind map I offer here come from a book Ronda Grizzle shared with me called Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. After offering a definition, I describe the general process, which involves a starting word, mapping out associations to that word, and then mapping out further secondary associations from there.

Images help to explain this better, I think, so I offer a picture of an example mind map from Designing Your Life, where someone is trying to brainstorm a potential career from things that interest them.

Next I suggest some reasons for mind mapping. By getting all of your ideas on the table, the process allows you to reflect more fully about which pieces are important to you. At the end of the mapping process, circling four or five of the words most important for you will help clarify which elements could be the basis for a good charter.

The starting word in the center of the map is important, as it generates the other associations for you. So I planned on reiterating the questions that we discussed in the course of discussion to help the students get started and to help generate other associations.

From there, the mind mapping activity involves the following:

Placing your starting word.
Mapping outwards for five minutes.
Reflecting on the resultant map for five minutes and circling important concepts.
Discussing with their neighbor for five minutes.

I’ve done a version of this activity for helping people develop a sense of their DH pedagogy, and I’ve found that mind mapping is great for helping participants engage in deeper forms of self-reflection about their everyday practices.
Timed Writing on Values
Now that the students have seen some examples and discussed them, it’s time for them to write. They’ll be in a decent place to do so, hopefully, because the mind mapping activity already asked them to think about large topics that were meaningful to them. As writing about values can sometimes feel frightening, I drew in Sean Michael Morris’s great rules for timed writing prompts here to help encourage the participants. I chose eight minutes, but you could give a longer amount of time - anything would be useful. After writing, I could imagine having a productive conversation about the results. The students need not feel pressured to share their exact wording, but a general discussion of the process, the issues, and things that they gravitated towards would be useful.

That’s it for the workshop and accompanying materials! Happy to talk with anyone who might be interested in working with them. The trip to Emory was very invigorating and provocative, and I was endlessly impressed, especially, by the students at ECDS. They’re a great crew. Keep an eye out for them - they’re already doing important work, and you’ll be hearing from them soon.

This week I’m at Digital Pedagogy Lab 2019, where I’m taking a course on Critical Open Pedagogy from Rajiv Jhangiani. For one of our prompts today, he asked us to respond to a post of his on 5 Rs for Open Pedagogy. The goal was to get us to reflect a bit on the values that bring us to the open space as well as the kinds of values that we bring with us. I think the aim was to come up with a concise, listicle style, but I didn’t quite follow that format. If I had to extract five verbs to describe what I write below about open pedagogy, they might be:

Care
Value
Share
Empower
Critique


The prompt and Rajiv’s post make me think of Erin Rose Glass’s incredible notion that if you stacked up all the papers written in all the courses in the world each semester they could reach the moon. Along with the image, she offers the provocative notion that those notes will all be thrown away at the end of the term. It’s an image to which I often return.
All that paper. All those ideas. All those people.
One of the things that brings me to open pedagogy is the idea that our students have something to contribute to the world. They are capable of good, complex thought, even about material that they are approaching for the first time. This is a belief about their ideas, but it’s also a comment on their value as people. In short, a degree is not necessary to prove your worth or your ability to think. A student’s thoughts are just as worthwhile as those of their teacher.
Open pedagogy is a practice that encourages us to think of student work as work, of student ideas as ideas. Students can change the world if we don’t get in the way. Instead of throwing their ideas away, we should approach them with care and attention.
But.
The world is a terribly risky and dangerous thing, a risk disproportionately shared by different groups of students based on identity and background. We cannot ask students to work in the open without pause. The task of the teacher is to help guide students in this space and to give them agency over their presence in it. To care and to steward, to collect and to distribute. But also to concede and to critique. To grant the right to be forgotten, as Tara Robertson reminds us. To allow for opting in as well as out.
Open is not universally good or universally available. A critical open pedagogy recognizes the limits and risks of open and educates students about this space so that they can be productive citizens of it if they so choose.
For me, then, open pedagogy is not just about distributing those pages rather than tossing them. It’s about taking them down from the stack and helping their author to think before throwing them away, even if they wind up deciding it’s necessary to do so.
Because it’s not just about the paper - it’s about the one who did the writing.

I was on a roundtable at ACH 2019 on The Life of a Lab, described on our slides as discussing “Cross-sectional issues of administration, funding, identity, and disciplinarity in DH labs.” The rough text of my talk follows along with my slides.

I’m Brandon Walsh, the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, a center for experimental scholarship in the University of Virginia Library, where our work is informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage. We are a part of and report through the library, and all but one of our employees are currently on hard salary lines. There’s much more to be said about nitty gritty things, and I’m happy to speak further in conversation with others about the Lab’s positioning and infrastructure. For now, I’ll just offer thoughts on this conversation from my own corner of our work, which is primarily student-driven and pedagogically inflected. The points I’ll raise aren’t ones we have the answers to necessarily, but they’re the work that we’re trying to think through.

I want to begin by situating my ideas in our space. This is a fisheye view of our public area (photo credit to Shane Lin), where students, faculty, and staff can collaborate on projects or get access to certain software packages (particularly GIS). It’s one of a few spaces we have, and we share it with the library and the public. Our makerspace is nestled in the back there, and any given day we have a number of people working there, some formally affiliated with us, some not. In the Lab we often say we prioritize building up people over projects. This positioning - this space that people move in and out of - both reflects and informs our philosophy in the Scholars’ Lab, which I’ve broken down here into a short list of points. Think of them as things I’d be likely to print out and pin to my wall as reminders/precautions/aspirations. Because of my own role, my remarks will largely deal with students.

Point 1: A lab’s community changes over time.
The life of a lab is one that waxes and wanes, that has lifecycles like any living thing. The Scholars’ Lab has a charter that expresses our values, but half of the people who wrote that document (one that is still very important to us) don’t work in the lab anymore (we’ll hopefully be renewing and rewriting soon). In the context of student work, one thing we think a lot about is how the community we give most of our resources to is necessarily going to leave (former Director Bethany Nowviskie has great reflections on this in her post “Too Small to Fail”). That’s not a problem per se. But it does lead to a difficult ebb and flow of outreach. It’s difficult to establish an identity on such shaky territory, and, yet, we’re nevertheless regularly called upon to do so. Life is about change.

Point 2: Community definitions include – and exclude.
We recently had something of a reckoning with our own identity as a digital humanities center - I think our reputation is largely as a DH center, but only about a third of our staff identified as DH. We’re still trying to reckon with this, but you caught a glimpse of it in how I defined what we do at the beginning of the talk. These definitional issues draw boundaries for people, and administrative choices can more explicitly delimit your community in exclusionary ways. From the student side of things, we work extensively with graduate students, but less so with undergraduates. MA students have a more difficult time finding their way into our named programs, and humanities-minded students in the sciences, architecture school, and others have bureaucratic difficulties to working with us. They still can, but the occasions are different. Much of my energy these days is spent trying to be more inclusive and inviting, both in abstract ways but also by dealing with red tape that throws up real barriers for people.

Point 3: A diverse community requires varied types of support.
Those different groups I mentioned? They all have different circumstances. MA students and PhD students, for example, all have different lived realities, positions in the university, goals, and needs. We’re constantly thinking about what meaningful units of support are – course credits, wages, stipends to offset teaching requirements. But there are also other things that are meaningful – help with professional development, emotional support, showing up for their dissertation defenses, etc. All of these things matter, but they matter in different ways to different people (and they cost different things to us as staff). This cuts across different areas of work as well. You can’t think about just one public or just one student body or just one monolithic Faculty with a capital F. It’s important to work across all these categories.

Point 4: Community members will leave.
A variation of point one. We do a disservice to our students and our community members if we are not thinking about what comes next for them. For our staff, it means encouraging professional development and recognizing that if they leave to go on to better things that means we’ve done our job well. For colleagues in precarious positions it means trying to advocate for the best possible circumstances for them we can, working against toxic systems that place them in such positions, and elevating their work and voices. For students in the Scholars’ Lab, this means engaging with a program called PHD+ that tries to prepare students for diverse career outcomes after graduating. It means having frank conversations with them about precarious labor in academia and in DH.

Point 5: We can always be better.
How can we be better? That’s the animating question that has been hovering behind all my comments so far and that drives my thinking on our student programs. For me, this means consistently re-reading and re-consulting the Postdoctoral Bill of Rights and the UCLA Student Collaborator Bill of Rights as touchstones for what we do. And groups like AADHum and DH-WoGeM are doing so much to elevate important conversations that we try (and will keep trying) to bring into our work in the lab. There are systemic forces structuring the way we interact with our community - and the way you interact with yours. Pushing back against them should be part of the long-term plans for a lab’s work. Even if things seem to be going well in a general sense, someone in your community is struggling.
Because talking about the life of a lab is really secondary to talking about the life -the lives - in a lab. We have a responsibility to do right by those people whom we teach, employ, collaborate with. This means approaching issues of infrastructure and administration with a sense of the lived impact these decisions have. We can always be better - there is always work to be done. That’s the work that we’re engaged in right now in the Lab.
I’m happy to talk more. For now I’ll yield to the rest of the group.

I’m a musician in my life outside of work, and one of my goals in the coming year is to explore the ways in which this part of my identity might intersect with my professional life as a DH teacher and researcher. I’m still working out what this looks like, but, for now, I’m exploring how critical making can give me a clearer sense of the technologies involved in musical production.
One thing I’ve been working on is the Pedal-Pi - a kit for building a guitar pedal that runs off a Raspberry Pi Zero. I picked this kit because it comes with just about every component you need to get going, as opposed to some other models that provide you with a shopping list but leave you to do the ordering (these options wound up being much more expensive all told). I’m interested in this project for a few reasons. For one, I don’t really have much sense at all of how electronics work or how the stuff I’m doing with an instrument gets processed into a digital format. For another, this pedal is pretty customizable. It comes with a variety of scripts written in C that you can use for effects out of the box, and I know just enough about programming to want to poke around under the hood of the thing.
Ammon ordered two kits for me in case I messed one up, which, as I describe below, turned out to be prophetic. Below is a short, bulleted list of reflections on the process so far.

The electronics (mostly) aren’t the problem. When I first started soldering, I was terrified I would mess something up, so I went slowly to make sure I didn’t set things on fire. Ironically, the first major issue I encountered had nothing to do with the electronics portion of the project. The issue was that I just wasn’t paying attention. Even after mentally repeating to myself again and again “OK A, B, and C get soldered into X, Y, and Z,” I still accidentally soldering something into hole D. It was reassuring to find that the main difficulties with the project were human. If you look closely at the C12 circle here you can see the remnants of the solder from where I put a component in the incorrect hole.
  

Like anything else, you get better with practice. I put a couple hours of work into the first pedal before I made the above mistake and shifted gears to start working on the backup kit. With that experience under my belt, I watched a couple soldering videos online to improve my technique. I was surprised to find that most of my bad results were because because I was too afraid. In most cases, I hadn’t applied enough heat to either the board or the component to get the solder to flow and connect well. The moral here - fear might be the mind-killer, but it also makes for some pretty lousy solder joints. I moved several times more quickly on the second pedal, and my work looked a lot better. I also started to compartmentalize the process a little. Rather than soldering one thing, checking my progress, and moving on, I would get several components in place before soldering them all at once. This process was a lot quicker, easier, and more effective. But it required me to have a little more confidence. Could always be better, but check out the joints on the second, improved pedal.
  


Even with electronics you can correct mistakes. Once I soldered a component in the wrong hole, I thought that the pedal was hopeless. But Shane showed me how to use desoldering wick, a material used to draw out unwanted solder, so that we could correct my error. We were able to heat the solder again and pull out the component that was in the wrong place, but that hole remained filled in. In order to clear the hole so that I can put new components in it, I’ll need to get a finer tip for our soldering iron. But I was surprised how many of the decisions we were making - actions that felt permanent - could still be undone. At one point, Shane went over a number of my joints on the first pedal and reshaped them for stronger and more conductive connections. I think I had this view that a circuit either worked or did not, and I was impressed with how a little tinkering could help you move between categories. I’m certain there are limits to all this, but I was surprised just how much flexibility you have.


People out in the world were having the same issues I was. The instructions for the Pedal-Pi are pretty thorough and helpful, but there was at least one spot where they seemed to assume a degree of familiarity with DIY electronics that I did not possess. In most cases, the instructions do a great job of letting you know when particular components have polarities that require them to be soldered in place in particular directions. One piece, however, didn’t mention anything about orientation being meaningful. The board uses two IC sockets, and there is a small dimple on one side of each socket to let you know the direction you should place them in. Presumably, this is a thing that those more familiar with circuits would just know. I checked online, though, and I was not the first person to have soldered a dip socket incorrectly. Allegedly, so long as I remember which socket is in backwards and adapt accordingly the board should operate fine. Again, I was happy to know I wasn’t the only one out there making mistakes. The reversed socket is at position U2 in this photo.
  

Sound and physical objects. The work in the makerspace has been interesting for the ways in which it has connected me with all the physical aspects of the music process. While it’s an oversimplification, I’ve sometimes thought of my work with music as ephemeral. When you paint something, you have a physical thing. If you sculpt something, you have a physical product. These physical objects persist. But a performance is tied to a particular time and place. Working on the guitar pedal has made me reflect on how my instruments are the product of centuries of engineering. So much making went into configuring my trumpet to help it sound just so, and music making is a deeply physical act. The electronics work in the makerspace has made me want to think more about all the different components of the pipeline, about the ways in which hardware and software affect the production of a musical experience.
  

Stay tuned for further reflections on this makerspace work in the future - I have one or two things to work out before I’m able to finish the pedal and start tinkering with effects. I’m looking forward to making some noise.

One thing I’ve realized about the Praxis Program, our year-long, soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities for a cohort of doctoral students, is that it changes each year. In my first year here, these changes were a source of anxiety for me. Surely, I thought, there must be a way to systematize the program, to find a format that would be more consistent, and, thus, more sustainable. Over the last two years, however, I’ve come to view these regular tweaks as a strength of the program. Rather than being locked into what we’ve done in the past, we’re committed to re-examining our assumptions and our plans. To illustrate this, I’d like to share an example of a problem we identified and some the ways we tried to address it during the past year.
At the end of every program, we run exit surveys with students and hold debrief conversations among the staff involved. Last year’s discussions brought up an important issue: for all of our talk about how the program is meant to be a curricular intervention in graduate studies and offer on-the-ground, hands-on training in the practical work of digital humanists, we were framing that work almost exclusively in the context of research projects. Our students left without much of a sense of digital pedagogy and what that might mean to them. Even though we encouraged students to document their process as the year went along, our emphasis on producing a digital project suggested that the work of a digital humanist is primarily project development. That might be true for a certain kind of digital humanities work, but it also leaves out so much of what these careers entail. By focusing our work in this way, we, and the students, seemed to be ignoring the strengths of the program as a teaching exercise itself.
Having identified this issue, we decided to spend a month or so of the following year’s program working on a new unit that I would construct on digital pedagogy. In addition to introducing the topic, part of our goal was to create a space for other kinds of outcomes for the year. Rather than having a single group project be the primary takeaway, I wanted our students to start thinking about the year as a portfolio of experiences with lots of different materials they could point to as their own. This addition would also help address one issue we’ve consistently found with the group project - by its very nature, it involves a degree of compromise from each student in the group. If the project feels too far afield from an individual student’s research agenda, it can be difficult to sell them on why they should remain engaged in the collective work. Expanding the range of results for the students also gave us new opportunities to create moments that would speak directly to the students’ individual research interests in a clearer way than we had in past. The whole sequence took place in four sessions.
Session One - Workshopping a Workshop
I called the introductory session to the digital pedagogy unit a “Workshop on Workshops,” a title that I took from a piece Zoe LeBlanc and I have coauthored for the forthcoming #DLFTeach Toolkit. That upcoming piece shares the spirit of what follows here, though with a different practical and theoretical framing. Keep an eye out for that volume, which should be dropping soon.
The assignment I gave the students was, over the course of a month, to create the structure for a ninety-minute digital humanities workshop related in some way to their own research interests. They certainly weren’t expected to know everything about the topic, but they could learn just enough to teach - just enough to teach to learn themselves. And, in an attempt to introduce them to a particular form of pedagogy that I tend to traffic in, I asked their workshop be a “low-tech, pencil and paper (ish) digital humanities workshop.” In terms of actual, tangible outcomes, at this stage I just asked they work towards having a blog post-length pitch with the idea, framing, and beginning skeleton for their session. They didn’t need to plan enough to actually give the workshop (yet! stay tuned, dear reader), but I wanted evidence that they had made significant progress in that direction. And the plan was that throughout the month we would workshop their materials together.
I suggested pencil and paper as a constraint by way of a reading we gave the students: “Beyond Buttonology: Digital Humanities, Digital Pedagogy, and the ACRL Framework” by John E. Russell and Merinda Kaye Hensley. The students read the piece, and we then opened the discussion with this quotation from it:

Knowing how to upload texts into a tool like Voyant does not help researchers think about what texts should be uploaded, how selecting data relates to a research question, or even what constitutes an effective research question.

The challenge for the students was to take seriously the provocation of the article, to get beyond workshops geared towards interfaces and tools (beyond buttonology) and towards concepts and methods. In doing so, I hoped, the students would realize that they could effectively approach and teach complicated digital humanities concepts as newcomers, even if they might be otherwise unfamiliar with the tools that might often be used to address these research questions. Learning about the former would hopefully mean they felt more comfortable exploring, evaluating, and recommending these tools to others. After introducing the concept of buttonology, we reflected on past technology workshops we had attended. What did good teaching look like in those contexts? What did less successful teaching look like? Was buttonology a concept or experience they had encountered before, even if they did not have a name for it?
We then got specific. In order to set the stage for this exploration, I modeled an example workshop for them by giving an introduction to sentiment analysis using pencil and paper. I’ve written about this particular workshop at length, so I won’t fully rehash the approach. Suffice it to say that I introduced the concept of sentiment analysis, asked the students to mark up by hand a passage for positive and negative polarity, and then used the resultant discussion to surface many of the underlying, humanistic issues with the methodology.
I’ve taught versions of this workshop in a number of contexts, but the difference here was that I approached it like something of a supervised laboratory experiment. I gave the workshop as normal, but I also described the theoretical and practical reasons behind my pedagogical choices as they took place in real time. It felt a lot like I was running two workshops simultaneously - the first was an introduction to text analysis, and the second was a higher-level conversation on the pedagogical environment and experience I conducted as I went. After the workshop ended, we took a few minutes to reflect on the teaching together. We talked about the advantages (discussion based, little room for technological failure) and disadvantages (difficult to connect it back to things they could immediately use) of the approach.
This mix of practical experience and theoretical reflection would come to be crucial in the coming months as we continued the exercise. With this initial workshop as a model, I challenged the students to aim for a similar outcome of their own from the unit. To get to that point, the following sessions would walk the students through a series of scaffolded exercises meant to draw them from point A to point Z. The follow-up assignment leading into the next session was for the students to reflect on their own, discipline-specific research interests. The students need only do some soul searching and come in with two or three large interventions that their dissertation projects made or, if they weren’t at that point in their programs yet, that they were interested in exploring as graduate students.
Session Two - General research interests
When we reconvened, we asked questions of each other to learn more about our individual research interests, and we offered some points of connection to larger digital humanities topics. By now the students had begun to gather some sense of the larger field, so they had developed the ability to say things like “You’re interested in textual editing? That reminds me of TEI, which we learned about a couple weeks ago.” They might not have felt prepared to go much deeper, but that was fine at this stage. I just wanted them to get things on the table.
In preparation for our next session, I asked the students to explore Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments, a fantastic collection of different activities and statements drawing from a wide variety of different areas. I often suggest the collection as an entry point for people interested in learning about DH but who haven’t found their own clearly defined entry point yet. With an eye to their own stated research interests, I asked them to select one or two sections of the volume to explore at length.
Session Three - General DH interests
In this session, we used the Digital Pedagogy volume as a bridge to help narrow each student’s focus within digital humanities. We went around the table and had each student share what they had explored and how it related to their research interests. We started to broach basic questions of pedagogy as well - what could they imagine being engaging to students about the topic? What would likely be difficult to grasp? How might the students address these issues?
Besides offering each of them a chance to think about their own interests, sharing and workshopping for each other meant that the students were also getting a lot of exposure to areas beyond their own interests. Our fellowship cohorts have six people in them, so they were getting a crash course in five topics outside their own field. This general approach guides much of Praxis - we frequently pair a deep dive into one subject or method with broad exposure to a variety of areas. The follow-up work from this session was to continue to narrow. The students had moved from disciplinary interests to DH areas, and now I wanted them to take the final step. I asked them to think through how they would teach something about this subject area to newcomers.
Session Four - Specific, Teachable DH Workshop Ideas
In the last session, the students shared their specific ideas for introductory digital humanities workshops with the group and offered feedback for one another. I continued to broach pedagogical issues, but the students were also quite good at flagging potential problems for each other. They gave strong feedback and asked good questions of each other:

What were the goals of the session?
What seemed the most challenging for the instructor? What were potential pitfalls?
Does the instructor seem to be planning too much?

With this feedback in mind, the students had one last chance to re-conceive of their work before delivering what, at the time, felt like their final outcomes. Several of the students wound up posting their workshop ideas to the blog. If you’re interested in seeing what they came up with check out the posts below:

Sounding Scholarship: A Workshop on Making Your Research Sing
String Theory, or: Let’s Explore Social Networks with String!
Teaching Transcription (and Secretly Metaphysics)

A general interest in networks in early American history found its way into a workshop on network analysis using string and rope. An interest in textual criticism lead to a workshop on digital editing and transcription. This certainly isn’t the only or best way to introduce students to digital pedagogy. I’ve already prepared a few changes for next year, including asking students to read more theory and readings to go along with the work they’re developing. But, all in all, I think the unit on pedagogy was a success. We had new conversations that hadn’t been a part of Praxis in the past, and it felt as though the shift towards teaching brought out the voices of students who were quieter at other parts of the process. The students also came away with a professionally legible piece they could add to their portfolios, and I felt they were better able to speak to the pedagogical intervention the program itself was trying to make.
As I had originally conceived it, the unit on digital pedagogy ended there. But it turns out the students were really excited about the work they had done and wanted to actually teach the workshops for a live audience. We wanted to honor that energy, so we unexpectedly gave the digital pedagogy unit a second life in the spring semester. I’ll write a second post that will describe that real-life road-testing soon.

When I sat down to write this post I had no ideas. That’s probably inevitable, given the year of blogging challenge that we’re undertaking in the Scholars’ Lab. The whole point is to write often and frequently, that there is value in a steady stream of thoughts rather than waiting for the perfect blog post, and that regular writing makes the whole thing easier. Still, all those good intentions didn’t help me as I struggled to put text to blank page. As I often do in those situations I got out a deck of cards and started playing.
I’ve been obsessed with Oblique Strategies for years now. If you’re not familiar, Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards published by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt that aims to offer short, pithy suggestions for getting around creative dilemmas. The idea behind them is that the serendipity of drawing a mysterious phrase from the deck will help disrupt any blocks you might have moving forward. I’ve got a stack of them that I keep on my desk, and it’s a comfort to know that I’ve always got a wrench to throw in the gears at any given time. This morning as I flipped through the deck for inspiration these were the cards that came up first:

When is it for?
Use an old idea
Turn it upside down
Once the search is in progress, something will be found
Humanize something free of error

A lot there! Surely, somewhere in there, I could find material for a successful blog post on digital pedagogy, the subject I’ve been trying to focus on with these regular posts. I did, and I could. But the activity interested me more: how could these cards - the idea of them more so than any one phrase on them - inform teaching within the field of DH more generally?
Of course, I’m not the first one to think about how Oblique Strategies might apply to DH. Mark Sample’s keynote for the first annual Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship took up this topic. In “Your Mistake was a Vital Connection: Oblique Strategies for the Digital Humanities,” Sample does a fantastic job articulating the potential for the deck to inspire digital humanities research and pedagogy. Sample advocates not just using the deck as a means to an end - he suggests making serendipity the process and outcome itself. The deck can be quirky way to step over difficulty and get back to the serious business of doing work, but it can also offer a reconsideration of what the work could look like in the first place.
Sample frames using Oblique Strategies in DH research and pedagogy as a question of embracing serendipity as a methodology. This seems to me to be right and correct, but his piece also makes me want to think further about how Oblique Strategies might offer ways for thinking through digital pedagogy in particular. Besides shuffling up any of those cards and thinking about any specific aphorism’s applicability to teaching in a DH context, what might a larger approach to digital pedagogy look like when informed by oblique strategies? Sample offers serendipity as a way into the question, but this is only one to think about the cards. After all, embracing chance as a methodology involves releasing something else - control.
Take the way Sample offers the same question I just posed: “How might oblique strategies not only be another way to work in general, but specifically, another way to work with the digital scholarship and pedagogy we might otherwise more comfortably approach head-on, as Brian Eno put it.” This reading frames use of the cards as a question of directionality but also of power - rather than assert power, the cards seem to say, give yourself over to the whims of chance, let your creative faculties engage, and step in from the side. In order to play the game as invited by Oblique Strategies, you have to first accept you might not have all the answers.
For me, this question of authority is the clearest link between the deck and how I might apply it in the DH classroom. For me, good digital humanities teaching is always about unsettling authority in the classroom. When digital humanists co-teach courses, they model how no one person has all the answers. When we encourage process and reflections on failure as important scholarly outputs, we encourage students to give themselves over to a more humane understanding of research. When we counsel students on imposter syndrome, we directly encounter the idea of the authority. There are more specific, personal implementations for me as well. When I run a class, I tend to ask more questions than I offer answers, and my ultimate goal is for the students to recognize that their own contributions to discussion can often be more valuable than mine.
All of this makes me want to ask: how can Oblique Strategies encourage a more student-centered pedagogy? How could we use the ethos of the cards to disrupt vectors of power in the classroom and create a more meaningful, inclusive teaching environment? What about this would be specific to digital pedagogy? In the spirit of what I’ve described above, I won’t offer answers (yours would be as meaningful as mine). Towards the end of Sample’s blog post he shares together a playful tool for generating your own oblique strategies for digital humanities. I thought I might take a similar approach, offering a few elliptical statements on how we might approach digital pedagogy obliquely in the aphoristic style of Oblique Strategies. I had originally intended to give brief glosses about how they might be interpreted, but I think that gets away from the spirit of the thing. In a riff on Wallace Stevens’ “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” I’ll give thirteen, lest any one appear to be more important than the others:
Thirteen Oblique Strategies for Digital Pedagogy

Create <-> consume
Analog digital
Interaction over interface
Displace authority
Questions
Allow for gaps
Process product
People first
Iterate
Cultivate imposterdom
Design Design
Can you fail?
Disrupt / connect

Of course, maybe the best oblique strategy would be to hand the students a blank deck with some colored pencils and ask them to draw for you.

As part of the Scholars’ Lab’s year of blogging, Amanda asked me to write a little about my pedagogy and things that have helped me find it. When someone asks me to do such a thing, I always think about a poll that Jesse Stommel put out on Twitter about pedagogical training in graduate programs. He asked:

Dear higher education teachers, a poll. Answer below, reply with stories, and pass along. How much training in teaching or pedagogy was/is included in your graduate program?

The majority of people responded to say their training amounted to “basically nothing.”
I consider myself in the “basically nothing” category as well. My program did have a single semester course for pedagogical training, but for a variety of administrative reasons, it was possible to slip through the cracks and start teaching without any formal training. This is not to say there was no teaching support - we did have the help of a faculty mentor while serving as a teaching assistant, and we graduate students had each other. But that kind of catch-as-catch-can approach to pedagogical training left me with what felt like a very spotty teaching background and loads of imposter syndrome.
So, in some ways, this post is a letter to myself from eight years ago. It talks about steps I’ve taken to develop a stronger sense of myself as a teacher. It’s worth noting at the outset here that teaching happens in many shapes and sizes - courses, workshops, weeklong institutes, one-on-one mentoring, etc. Similarly, your pedagogy itself manifests in a variety of different ways, but it should ideally inform every decision you make about yourself as a teacher, your students, and everything in between. It’s also worth noting that these steps are more truly about pedagogy generally - digital pedagogy is a related subject that overlaps with this one that merits its own discussion. But the steps below could certainly get you started thinking your way through a pedagogy in that field as well.
Hopefully, what follows will help someone else work their way towards a more informed, aware, and critical sense of their own pedagogy. I’m still learning, and these are the steps I’m taking to do it.
What’s a Pedagogy?
When I put together my first syllabus, I had no idea where to start. I didn’t even really know what the genre looked like, despite having seen syllabi many times before. So I collected a bunch of example syllabi from friends and looked at what others had done. Using these pieces, I started assembling a Frankenstein’s monster of a syllabus that, when I looked down, was eight pages long and had pages of policies, rules, and readings.
Do these sort of things inform your teaching? Sure. Are they your pedagogy? No…or not exactly. An important first step is recognizing something that Jim Seitz, UVA’s Director of Academic and Professional Writing, told me at a later date - your pedagogy is what arises out of your motivation and thinking behind every decision related to the classroom. Those rules and policies were not my pedagogy, but they were expressions of it. They reflected a variety of different ideas about who my students were, how I viewed the classroom, and how we would all be interacting with each other.
Of course, when writing that initial syllabus, I didn’t know anything about all this - I was grabbing pieces that felt right without thinking too much about them. At the end of it all, I remember looking down at the resulting syllabus and thinking, “It sounds like I’m going to run this class on film musicals like it’s a police state.” So I deleted 90% of the rules and policies and started over. There was a pedagogical reason behind my doing this, but I didn’t really know it at the time. For me, discovering my own sense pedagogy has been about reclaiming agency over these sorts of impulses. I’ve learned what I care about, what I don’t, and places where I can express my vision of what teaching should be.
How Do I Find Mine?
The first thing to know about teaching is that if you’re asking that question you’re already moving in the right direction. These steps can help.


Think about what you’re doing. You might not realize all the different components that go into the classroom, but every one of these could merit further examination. Everything from the way you dress to the way you interact with your students to whether you sit or stand while teaching can be things to think further about. Think about all the different elements that make up your teaching experience.


Recognize which of the things you’re doing are choices. Most teaching situations bring with them a variety of constraints. Depending on your situation, you might not be able to adjust certain elements of the classroom. Of course, these sorts of restrictions can still be worth examining more closely - you might not always be constrained in this way, and it can be useful to have deeper thoughts about what you’re doing even if you can’t change it.


Work from specific to abstract. Take a look at one thing you do and try to find the principle behind it. Given the entire world of possibility, what was it that would lead you to choose to do that one thing and not any others? And then take that justification and get even more abstract - why is it so important to you? To offer one example: when I run discussion I tend to contribute more questions than I do statements. As students respond to the questions, I give more. I do this because I’m genuinely interested in what the students have to say. And I think the underlying belief here is that students, even while learning, can make important contributions to complex discussions that are at least as important as anything I can offer.


Observe others teach. Growing up, you probably spent a lot of time in classrooms as a student. But the irony is that, once it became clear that you would do some teaching, you probably didn’t get much of a chance to see how others do it. Education programs generally have student experiences designed to address this gap, but I think it’s the case that graduate students in the humanities don’t get enough opportunities to observe others. And you can’t rely on your memories of what good and bad teaching looked like - it’s fundamentally different to be a student than to be an outsider thinking about the logistics of how it all gets put together. So ask others if you can watch them teach. While some people might be self-conscious about the activity, you’ll get some people willing to let you sit in on a class. And while you’re watching, take notes about everything from the students to the teacher to the general classroom environment. Everything can be grist for your mill.


Talk with others you respect about their teaching. This point can be taken in isolation, but it works best with observing someone teach. It often works well to get context for what goes on in a given classroom session. If the instructor has a lesson plan prepared in advance, ask them to send it to you (or at least a few sentences about what they’re planning to do). After the session, ask if you can follow up to talk about what you saw. Keep in mind that you’re asking the observee to do work for you. I sometimes offer to buy coffee to sweeten the deal if necessary, though this might not be financially possible for you. You might also offer to have them observe you in turn. When talking, it can often be a good entry point into the conversation to ask them how they thought the session went. And beyond observing individual classes, you should explore whether your institution (or one nearby if you don’t have one) has a group dedicated to teaching and pedagogy whose work and conversations you can tap into.


Read and learn more. Depending on your own background, this fact might get obscured, but pedagogy is an area of study - and research - like any other in academia. There are countless scholars working to advance conversations about pedagogy, and beginning to read around in the field can help you to discover where you fit in. You might start off by reading people discussing teaching as it relates to your specific field to get a general sense, but strong pedagogy frequently transcends the disciplines in which it manifests. As with any discipline, you won’t agree with everything you read. If you’re reading this, odds are you are in some way interested in how we run our student programs in the Scholars’ Lab. A pedagogical starter pack for us might include Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed, bell hooks’ Teaching to Transgress, Cathy Davidson’s The New Education, and L. Dee Fink’s Creating Significant Learning Experiences. As with any good lit review, I find it works well to read any given piece looking what I am going to read next. I’m always looking for my next citation. So as you’re going, keep an eye out for any compelling citations that might offer good opportunities for digging deeper into the conversation in the future.


Where to Start. You might try a thought experiment: imagine that your supervisor has asked you to take on a new course/workshop/student. In short, you’ll be doing exactly what you currently do but with one crucial difference - they will dictate everything about your teaching. Everything will be decided for you and you will have few freedoms. But they recognize your strengths as a teacher and are willing to compromise - you can bring three things over from how you used to teach. Only three - pick the most important parts of what you do. Start with the three treasured components, find the beliefs that underlie them, and you’ll be well on your way to developing a stronger sense of your pedagogy.


Hopefully the above activities will help someone reading this think more deeply about their teaching. The above suggestions are all born out of my own experiences with pedagogical training and growth - your mileage may vary. If you have had wildly different experiences I would love to hear more about them. My last suggestion is to write your pedagogy down. These writings might take many forms. The Scholars’ Lab has tried to express our pedagogy in the form of a charter. You might choose to blog about it or construct a generalized teaching statement, but, whatever form you choose, writing about your teaching will help you develop a better sense of it. And that labor is not for nothing - there are a number of great venues for writing about pedagogy, and doing so can be a professionally legible activity in its own right.
The world needs more teachers, and it needs more good thinking about teaching. Contribute yours to the conversation.

Alison Booth and I are co-teaching a graduate course this semester on Digital Literary Studies. As a part of the course, we’re having a series of technical workshops - command line, Python, text analysis, encoding, and markup. The scheduling worked out such that these workshops wound up being on Wednesdays, with the discussions of critical theory on digital humanities and literary method mostly on Mondays. That’s all fine and good, but I worried that neatly dividing the class out in that way would create a divide between the one day of the week when the students were actively discussing the material in the course and the other when they were mostly in hands-on workshops. Rather than having a hacking day and a yacking day, I wanted to see what I could do to create an environment for hack-yacking. So when I taught the first workshop on command line, I wanted to try something slightly different from what I normally do by making more room for discussion. I wanted to bring the Monday readings and conversations back into the Wednesday workshops.
Teaching programming well is very difficult. An easy, low-hanging fruit way to get the material across to your students is to connect your laptop and type in front of the students, explaining your keystrokes as you go and asking them to mirror your actions. Another approach I’ve seen (and used) uses slides to do something similar - sharing code examples and interspersing theoretical concepts as you go. Both of those approaches are all to the good, but they feel a bit too much like lecturing to me. I was trained as a teacher of English literature, which means that my bread and butter is the seminar. My approach to the discussion seminar has always been to act as something of a void in the center of the class, asking questions that get the students to engage with the material and each other more than with me. Lecturing has its place, I’m sure, but it generally makes me uncomfortable and doesn’t reflect the kind of pedagogy I value. So when teaching this workshop on command line I wanted to push myself a little more to see how much discussion I could incorporate into a technical skills workshop. How could I use this experience to help the students begin to think about technology as something that they could engage critically with? as something that was not so alien from their normal work of thoughtful, critical discussion?
My goals for the seventy-five minute session, then, were as follows:

Introduce the concept of the graphical user interface (GUI)
Introduce the concept of the command line
Give practice with the command line
Use the command line to do something that connected with the discussion we had been having elsewhere in the course

The overriding concern for me was to communicate the technical skills the students needed while not making it a “watch what I type” workshop. I wanted discussion and engagement to be the main priority.
To start off, I shared several different images of graphical user interfaces like this one.

I began by simply asking the students to describe what they saw, framing the activity as continuous with their usual practices of analyzing prose, poetry, or photographs. In the same way that any piece of a text or image can be interpreted and described, so too can technology be subjected to the same analysis. This component of the workshop was inspired by Erin Rose Glass. When she visited the Scholars’ Lab last semester for a talk on surveillance capitalism, she asked the audience to close read the Microsoft Word interface, and I thought the move did a great job of defamiliarizing an everyday piece of technology and subjecting it to critique. In this case, I asked my students a series of questions:

What kind of assumptions does the GUI make of its users?
What kind of an experience does it want you to have?
How does it structure that experience?
What kind of audience does it have in mind?

These provocations led to an interesting conversation about accessibility, design, and assumed expertise. I especially wanted the students to note how the GUI makes immediately apparent a range of options to the user. But those options are also limited. The interface sacrifices possibility for practicality, and it can never give you every possible option. This discussion set us up well for the next image I presented to them - a terminal window.

Again, I paused for discussion, asking questions that directed the students to the lack of clearly visible options in the terminal and how this suggested an assumption that its users would have a certain level of expertise. For better or for worse, it assumes that you know what you’re doing. I could have just told the students all this, of course, but I wanted them to arrive at these ideas themselves. So I mostly framed the activity with questions and helped to direct discussion, just as I would in directing close reading of a passage in a novel. In some small way, I hoped the activity would show them that the close reading and analytical skills they developed in other English classes would still be applicable here, even though the objects of study might be different and even though they might feel a bit at sea.
With some sense of what the command line was, the next phase of the workshop took the students through a variety of commands with the terminal. This component of the class felt the most like a typical introduction to the terminal in that I offered a command, executed it, and then we reflected on the results together. The commands we covered mostly focused on navigating the file system and adding or deleting files:

cd
ls
pwd
touch
rm
mkdir
cp
mv
man

Nothing too fancy or tricky. From a practical standpoint, the students needed to get the terminal under their fingers so that they’d be prepared to work with it for the rest of the course. As preparation for this piece, we had the students work through the Command Line Crash Course from Learn Python the Hard Way. So the workshop was not their first moment experiencing the terminal, and I could review these pieces quickly before trying to engage the students further.
One easy way to try to bridge the gap between our discussions of readings and our workshop on the terminal was to drawn in one of the texts that they had read and discussed in a previous session. Superficially, this meant that the students would at least have familiar thematic material in front of them - I selected an essay for us to work with by Katherine Bode titled “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ And ‘Distant’ Reading; Or, toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History.”
The students had been reading a cluster of essays about distant and close reading, and, for our last activity together, I wanted to defamiliarize the process of reading using the command line to further that discussion. The plan was to have our students use the terminal to “read” that article in a number of different ways. At each step along the way, we stopped to reflect on the kinds of reading enabled or inhibited by the commands.
I put the text of the article in question up on my website ahead of time so that they could easily access it. First I had the students use the curl command to copy down the text of a URL onto their computer (note that I’ve since taken this text down):
$ curl walshbr.com/materials/bode.txt

The curl command spits the text of this page onto their screen, which lead to an interesting conversation about this as a type of reading. I asked the students to characterize the kind of reading it did or did not seem to enable. For one, they noted the lack of an ability to paginate through the text, which seemed to imply that the command was meant for readers that planned to take in the text all at once. As in, curl might be meant for machines using a text as data rather than a thing to be read in a more humanistic sense.
To ensure that we all had the necessary materials, we grabbed that same text and sent it into a text file on our computer:
$ curl walshbr.com/materials/bode.txt > bode.txt

This simple command allowed us to talk about how to get web texts and pages onto your computer, gave us occasion to discuss those situations in which you would want to do so, and began a discussion about the kinds of reading possible in different interfaces for reading texts. We then moved along to a couple of different commands for getting text out of a file and onto your screen using the command line.
First, we got all of the text at once.
$ cat bode.txt

Second, we got a version that would allow us to proceed through the text page by page.
$ less bode.txt

These commands led to some good reflections on the embodied experience of paging through a physical book with your hands as opposed to using the space bar to do a similar activity. We also talked about the different kinds of reading that we might want to carry out, both in general and in digital literary studies. We don’t engage in texts the same way every time we use them, and these restrictive modes of reading foreground that. In one great moment, a student realized that he couldn’t get out of the interface created by the less command - “I can’t stop paging! I’m trapped in the text!”
From there, we used the terminal to search for particular words (the word “reading” in this case):
$ grep reading bode.txt

And then we counted the number of times a particular word occurred in our text:
$ grep reading bode.txt -c

By searching for particular words relevant to the themes of the text, we had a good discussion about the point at which characters and words on a page become meaningful. In particular, the students noticed that, for a computer, capitalization matters in a way that it does not for a human reading a document. They inferred the differences between tokens and types, the difference between any particular occurrence of a sequence of characters and that word as a unique vocabulary unit. In order to really find out how often the term “reading” appeared in the text, the students realized they would need to normalize everything by converting it to lowercase.
I’ve done workshops on the terminal in the past, but this was the first one where I tailored the commands we would be practicing to the subject-matter at hand. Besides the basics of how to interact with the file system, we really only worked with commands relevant to getting and examining textual data. The workshop helped the students come to an understanding that computers read quite literally, with no context or knowledge by default. Later on, the students would find these suspicions corroborated in a reading by Johanna Drucker on “Why Distant Reading Isn’t,” where she suggests that computational reading might be the closest reading of all. Using the terminal as a point of entry into those conversations meant that the students could find their own way to these concepts. In the future I’ll keep this sort of discipline-specific approach to teaching technical skills in mind. It worked well for making the material more immediately relevant and accessible to the students than it might have been otherwise.

Well, that’s a wrap. The fall semester is done, and 2019 is getting started. Actually, when I first started drafting this post the previous spring semester had just finished wrapping as well. This post has been sitting in my drafts folder since spring of 2018, so I wanted to try to push this out before another semester flew by.
At the end of the spring 2018 semester, the Praxis students presented reveal.scholarslab.org to an utterly packed house, which meant that the first full cycle of Scholars’ Lab student programs under my watch had taken place. It feels like I just got here, but, as I like to mark milestones, it felt worth reflecting on a few lessons from the last year (and then some). In addition, I’ve found myself often describing a few basic theoretical and practical tensions at the heart of our fellowship programs to anyone who is interested in what we do, so it seems worth writing down my thoughts on them in a wider, more public forum. This post, then, will aim to do both of those things by offering a bit of a glimpse into the history of one of our programs and the thinking behind it. In particular, I’ll talk about the line we try to walk between student-centered learning and project-centered learning. I’ll be talking about what Praxis works on each year and how we go about picking that project. Because, frankly, the questions about our programs that I’ve gotten most often over the course of the last year are “what are they?” and “what are they working on?”
Some background and practical considerations. The Praxis Program is just one of our fellowship programs each year, but, as it serves more students than our programs, I think it’s safe to say that it takes up the most mental energy of everyone in the lab. Each year, we take six humanities students from various departments around the University (this year we have our first Architecture School student!) and offer them a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities work. The fellowship asks for about ten hours of attention from the students each week in the form of a weekly meeting or two and collaborative work in a number of forms. The students are funded to participate in it by way of reducing their teaching obligations for the year - the students get time to learn and grow together as a result of the reduced course load. You can read more about the program on the project website, the DH abstract for the poster the team presented when the project first launched, or in this introductory post by Bethany Nowviskie. The program draws together several strands of pedagogical theory, a sampling of which might include Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed, the UCLA Student Collaborator’s Bill of Rights, or many of the writings of bell hooks.
We’ve published a pair of charters outlining the pedagogical obligations we feel towards our students, both in the Praxis program and in our programs more generally. (These charters didn’t exist when I first drafted this post in the spring of 2018. That’s one benefit of waiting seven months to finalize a post!) Check those documents out for general statements about our belief in public, process-driven pedagogy. But those statements won’t illuminate much about the day-to-day of what life is like for our students in our programs. Nor will they necessarily illuminate much about the logistics of how we carry out a fellowship year. So I thought I would share a little more about those specifics - what our students work on and how they get there. After all, the theory informs the doing, and the writing of those documents helped shape our programs this year.
One thing I’ve been thinking a lot about this year is the primary vehicle by which we facilitate the learning process in the Praxis program - the project. I usually put it this way: Praxis is a year-long fellowship that has a distinctive shift in feel between the fall and spring semesters. In the fall, there is still a fair amount of the Scholars’ Lab staff in the front of the class leading seminars or giving workshops to the students, as you might expect from a class where they will be learning a lot of digital methods. But we also share a range of strategies and techniques that aim to give a high-level look at all the different components of digital work - intellectual property, project scoping and management, collaboration planning, and way more (you can check out the common curriculum here). Most importantly, we help them think about what they’ll be doing together during the year: we help them design and scope a project that they’ll be working on in the spring, when we shift to much more of a hands-on, side-by-side, lab approach to the learning experience. While we still think a lot in the spring, our day-to-day work is mostly taken up working together to make the thing happen. We try to give the students power over the process all year long, but this is really evident in the spring when we put them in charge as much as possible.
Folks interested in Praxis often ask what the students are working on because, at the end of the day, people know that we want them to build something. But how they get to it has changed significantly over time. In another post by Nowviskie, she mentions that “It’s just too much to ask that students new to digital humanities work invent a meaningful project from whole cloth on Day 1 of the program — especially one that, we hope, will make a meaningful intervention in the current scene of DH research and practice.”
I think it’s worth sharing a little Praxis history here. (I should say at the outset of this discussion that, while I was a student in the second cohort of the program, I was never really privy to the pedagogical conversations that drove the fellowship. So take all of these observations from the outside with a grain of salt, except for the last year or so where I am happy to take any blame.) The compromise in the first few years was to give the students a piece of vaporware or a project already in progress and, within those restrictions, ask the students to make this kernel of an idea their own and to develop their own intellectual contribution based on it. The first Praxis cohort developed Prism, a digital version of a vaporware experiment in collaborative textual analysis and visualization developed by Nowviskie and SpecLab. The second cohort extended Prism, adding in new features based on their own interests and priorities, with the goal of taking the project from a proof of concept to a tool that was more open and usable. Accordingly, Prism has seen significant uptake, particularly in K-12 classrooms as a pedagogical tool for teaching a variety of reading and interpretive skills.
In its third year, the program took a similar approach to developing a project - the staff tasked the Praxis cohort with developing a new version of Ivanhoe, another older Scholars’ Lab project that was an exercise in collaborative interpretation and literary intervention, that would run as a WordPress theme. The following year, the fourth cohort of students redesigned Ivanhoe further to allow multimedia contributions.
So, in one sense, the first four years of the Praxis program were heavily directed - the core project was given, but the intellectual framing, stakes, and intervention itself were left to the students. Because of this, the students were saved the difficult task of making a from-scratch contribution to a field they were just learning for the first time. The students still maintained ownership of the project, but the initial guidance meant that the projects were able to go quite far for student projects. Each project ran on a two-year cycle, which meant that one cohort was tasked with the heavy lifting of developing a first pass at the digital project while the next would inherit the intellectual weight of conversations they hadn’t participated in. Each cohort got different glimpses of the lifecycle of a digital project.
The next three years were even more student-directed. The students still were given wide latitude over the kinds of skills they took away and the nature of the project that developed at the end, but different productive constraints were used to guide the work of the group. The staff stepped back a bit more in years five and six of the program and did not explicitly give a project to the students. Rather than being given an explicit project, the students were given an idea or topic. In each case, the students were told to think about the concept of time and develop a project that would intervene in our understanding of it. Naturally, the slightly more free-form approach meant that the students had the leeway to take wildly different approaches. The fifth cohort developed ClockWork, which used sonification to grapple with the monetary measurements of time. The sixth cohort took time as encouragement to think about social media as the best representation of the now, and these investigations led them to think about the social media ecologies of the Kardashian family. In the seventh year, my first in charge of the program, we stepped back even more, leaving off the time prompt for the students. We came in with a light plan but really followed student interests where they wanted to go, giving broad freedom over the direction of the program and the project. The result was UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University, a project that used augmented reality to layer contextual information onto public spaces to challenge public narratives of contested spaces. Ironically, even though time wasn’t the students’ focus, the project still deeply engaged in questions of the past, the present, and the stories we tell ourselves about both.
For the eighth, current year of the program we’ve instituted some significant changes to things that I will write more about in the future. But relevant to this discussion about freedom vs. constraint is that we returned somewhat to the roots of the program, providing the students with a fairly well defined kernel of an idea to make their own and implement in their own way. Students this year are working with the library’s Director of Information Policy to develop a project that engages with the ramifications of January 1st, 2019, when new works entered the public domain for the first time since the passage of the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act. I can go on about how excited I am for it, but I’d prefer for the students to frame the intervention themselves when they’re ready to do so. Keep an eye out for those insights!
Therefore, in answer to the question “What is Praxis working on?” I’d say: the students have worked on many different types of things over the years.
I think, however, that people ask what we’re engaged with presently not just to get a sense of the final product, but also in an attempt to better understand our process. Because no matter how public and transparent we try to be, the program is always happening for a small group of students behind doors that, if not closed, are cracked only slightly (we’re a library after all).
In that case, I have a slightly more boring answer to the question that I think really gets at the heart of the program.
What is Praxis working on?
We’re working on it.
The truth is we could have the students work on pretty much anything. The discussions would change, and the interventions into the scholarly conversations might be more or less incisive. But the built project is only part of the equation for us. And as the Scholars’ Lab charter states, the development of our people is at least as important as the projects or products themselves. The thing the students work on is less important than what that object can do in the service of the larger group. Our real aim is to build up the students as confident, conversant scholar-practitioners of digital method.
Praxis can be difficult to describe because it changes every year, and that’s by design. The content of the project changes, sure, and the students necessarily change. But the staff also changes - the lab has had a lot of turnover since Praxis began. I’m now the third or fourth person to take charge of Praxis, and we all have different ways of running things and conceptualizing the program. Rather than think of the program as a search for the perfect approach to project-based pedagogy, in the last year I’ve really come to see its evolving nature as a strength. When I’m asked what is Praxis working on, I’m led to think about how we’re constantly trying to reshape our fundamental assumptions, re-evaluating the process, and making changes based on the needs of our students. The staff are always working on the fellowship program itself.
Because process is everything. How we have students approach the work can really set the students up for success for failure-even more than the nature of the project itself. In the Scholars’ Lab, we’re committed to putting the students in charge of their education. But doing so can take a lot of different shapes, and Praxis has led to a lot of questions for me in the last year - questions that have been going round in my head all year and that have drifted outwards in this post. What are our limits at the lab in how design the student experience? How free can we be? How constrained? I’ve taken to jokingly describing the Praxis program as a riff on the tagline of the old MTV show Real World - “seven strangers picked to live in a house.” Except, in our case, we have six strangers picked to work on a project together. Are we setting them up for drama worthy of reality TV or for transformative learning experiences?
What is Praxis working on right now?
We’re working on being better. More on that soon!

I am pleased to announce that the Scholars’ Lab and UVA Library have been awarded $6,000 by the UVA Parents’ Fund to increase capacity for augmented and virtual reality teaching and research on grounds. The grant will support a small cohort of students this calendar year as they work with us to create public, novice-friendly documentation on how we apply these technologies to learning and research. If time allows and given student interest, they will also co-teach a workshop series on augmented reality for the university and Charlottesville communities and develop cultural heritage 3D data for preservation in our institutional repository. The hope is that this work will increase our capacity to support interest in these technologies, make our own lessons available to a broad public, offer professionally legible work for the students working to develop the project with us, and establish these same students as a community of experts who can help pay their experiences forward to others. The project is lead by Scholars’ Lab staff Brandon Walsh, Arin Bennett, and Will Rourk.
We are very grateful to the Parents’ Fund for their generous support of the Lab and of the Library!

Calling all UVA grad students! There’s snow on the ground, but it’s never too early to start thinking about spring. Or about what you’ll be doing next year!
Consider spending some time with us. The call for applications for next year’s Praxis cohort is now open!  Applications are due February 28th, 2019.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and a Public Domain Toolkit for documenting the affects of legal changes on our ability to teach and research with free culture.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Graduate Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent. The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow;
and your availability on the days we’ve identified for group interviews March 18th from 11:00 to 12:00 and March 19th from 9:00 to 11:30. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process as well as completed application materials should be directed to Brandon Walsh.
We hope that you’ll consider applying. Please circulate broadly to all of your friends, colleagues, and students.

We are now accepting applications for the 2019-2020 DH Fellows Cohort!
Applications are due Friday, November 30th.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester.  A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements


Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.


The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.*


Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.


Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.


A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.


How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials, all of which should be emailed directly to Brandon Walsh:


a cover letter, addressed to the selection committee, containing:


a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;


a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;


and a description of UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;




a Graduate Fellowship Application Form;


a dissertation abstract;

We are thrilled to announce the 2018-2019 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program, the Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship, and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 11 fellows from 6 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences and the School of Architecture. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past fellows!
Praxis Program
We are delighted to welcome 6 diverse disciplinary team members to the 8th year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:


Catherine Addington (Spanish)


Zhiqiu Jiang (Urban and Environmental Planning, Constructed Environment)


Eleanore Neumann (Art and Architectural History)


Mathilda Shepherd (Spanish)


Chloe Wells (Art and Architectural History)


Chris Whitehead (History)


Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s new project in the fall!
Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship
This year we will welcome 3 students to our short-term fellowship dedicated to boosting nascent digital humanities research in a flexible, collaborative environment.


Alyssa Collins (English, Fall 2018)


Christian Howard (English, Fall 2018)


Sarah McEleney (Slavic Languages and Literature, Summer 2018)


Alyssa and Christian will collaborate on a scraping and archiving project working with twitter data as it pertains to the relationship between literature and social justice. Sarah will be working on a project using machine learning to examine social realism in Soviet-era literature. These students will work with our R&D team for a single semester to rapidly prototype their project ideas and position themselves for future work in digital humanities. Look for more from them this coming year!
Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities
Finally, we are looking forward to working with Kelli Shermeyer and Sean Tennant, our 2018-2019 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.


Kelli Shermeyer’s (English) dissertation is titled  “Less-than-Human” Tragedy?: Ecologies of Suffering in Contemporary Tragic Drama.


Sean Tennant’s (Art and Architectural History) dissertation is titled Domestic Spaces in the Roman West: Architectural Adaptation in Gaul, Britannia, and Germania.


These fellows will work with our team throughout the year on substantial research projects related to their dissertations.
We are looking forward to working with all these fantastic students in the coming year!

I want to share several developments from the grad programs side of the Lab this semester. It’s been a busy fall, and I’m pleased with all the work the team has put into our programs!
For one, the CFPs for two of our fellowship programs are now live. The Praxis Program, which will welcome its eighth cohort next year, will have a deadline of February 15th for applications from PhD students at UVA. This flagship program is in many ways the core of our graduate community, and we’re very excited that it continues to thrive. I am also very pleased to announce that the Digital Humanities Prototyping fellowships, piloted this past year with a cohort of four students, will continue next year with its own application deadline of February 15th. Open to PhD and MA students at UVA, these fellowships are meant to shore up our support of students in the intermediate years of their graduate work, to provide collaborative projects a space in our fellowship portfolio, and to give young scholars a chance to craft a spark that might catch further down the line with applications for further funding here or elsewhere. Please tell your students and colleagues! I always strongly encourage students to get in touch with me if they are planning to apply - that way they will be on our radar for other opportunities down the line regardless of how this particular application shakes out. Along with our newly restructured DH Fellows program, these three fellowship programs provide support and experience for more stages of the graduate student timeline than was previously possible.
In addition to the fellowship announcements, I also wanted to draw attention to a revamping of what was formerly known as the “graduate fellowships” page. Our programs have grown a lot since this page was last revised, and the new “graduate fellowships and opportunities” page now better represents the wealth of offerings in the Scholars’ Lab. This new, catch-all page offers a space where students can see all of our opportunities beyond our annual fellowship programs. We regularly employ graduate students as Makerspace Technologists to assist in 3D printing and experimental computing in our makerspace (and we just released a call with multiple openings for spring 2018!). Cultural Heritage Informatics Interns each semester work with Will and Arin to 3D scan, process, and print artifacts all while getting course credit. Chris and Drew regularly work with student GIS Technicians who assist in the uploading of GIS datasets and creating applications on our GIS portal, all while getting valuable experience in spatial humanities. And, finally, a Mellon-funded collaboration with Washington and Lee University allows us to send students to their campus to give workshops on digital humanities to undergraduate courses. The amount of experience required for all these opportunities is quite variable, so be sure to read closely - in many cases we are more than happy to have you learn on the job. We’ve been doing all these things for quite a while, but hopefully now students can find easier access to information about our programs and how to get involved.
Finally, I’m especially pleased to share that we have a new section in this page on professional development for graduate students. The Scholars’ Lab programs give students valuable experiences and training, but we’ve also historically gone further than these official offerings. As UVA students apply to alt-ac and DH careers, we regularly give advice on the whole process, from finding a job to producing materials to interviewing. These offerings have long been ad hoc and by request, but I worried over the last several months that some potential students might get left out of such arrangements. A student might not know, for example, that we’d be willing to mock interview them in the happy event that they’re invited to campus for that digital humanities developer position. Or a student putting together their first job talk for a post-doc in digital humanities might not realize that we’re happy to lend a friendly ear and also share our own job talks.
This section is not perfect, and it by no means represents the sum of what any program can do to support graduate students. If you see something missing, drop me a line to let me know. But hopefully the statement of services there will serve as nice counterpoint to the values that we lay out in our group charter; hopefully the page’s presence will help someone find their way to us who might not otherwise have done so. After all, tacit assumptions about how others perceive our services can lead to people falling through the cracks, feeling like they’re going through a job search alone. Best that we be explicit, and best that we match our values with public statements of what we will do to back them up.
So in short - we’re here for you. If you’re part of the UVA community and looking for help with your DH or alt-ac job search, swing on by and let me know how we can help!

[Read closely: our menu options have changed. Note especially the changes to the application timeline, eligibility, and funding structure of the fellowship. Questions should be directed to Brandon Walsh, Head of Graduate Programs for the Scholars’ Lab.]
We are now accepting applications for the 2018-2019 DH Fellows Cohort!
Applications are due Wednesday, November 1st.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
Supported by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund, and a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester.  A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh.
See past fellowship winners on our People page. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements


Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.


The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.*


Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.


Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.


A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.


How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials, all of which should be emailed directly to Brandon Walsh:


a cover letter, addressed to the selection committee, containing:


a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;


a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;


and a description of UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;




a Graduate Fellowship Application Form;


a dissertation abstract;


and 2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation.


Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well.

Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award.

For the third year in a row, the Scholars’ Lab and the University of Virginia Library are helping host summer fellows from the Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative (LAMI) at UVA. The students will pursue original research this summer at UVA in consultation with a faculty mentor. For our part, the Scholars’ Lab and the Library have worked with Keisha John, Director of Diversity of Programs in the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, to organize a weekly series of workshops introducing the students to digital humanities and library research methods. They’ll be getting a broad introduction to digital research and the resources of the library as they think towards graduate school, and we’ve also coordinated weekly board game sessions over lunch (for SLab-style bonding).
In addition to introducing these students to the resources available at UVA and in the library system, the program aims to increase the number of demographically underrepresented students pursuing graduate work and careers in the academy. You can find more information about the program in a 2015 press release put out by UVA Today when our first cohort was in residence. Two of our own graduate fellows, Jordan Buysse and Sarah McEleney, are serving as dh mentors.
These are the students that you might meet if you happen to be around the Scholars’ Lab this summer. Look for more information about them and their projects by clicking through to their bios!

For the past several years, I’ve taught a Humanities Programming course at HILT. The course was piloted by Wayne Graham and Jeremy Boggs, but, these days, I co-teach the course with Ethan Reed, one of our DH fellows in the Scholars’ Lab. The course is a soup-to-nuts introduction to the kinds of methods and technologies that are useful for humanities programming. We’re changing the course a fair amount this year, so I thought I’d offer a few notes on what we’re doing and the pedagogical motivations for doing so. You can find our syllabus, slides, resources, and more on the site.
We broke the course down into two halves:


Basics: command line, Git, GitHub, HTML/CSS

Project: personal website



Programming concepts: Ruby

Project: Rails application deployed through Heroku and up on GitHub



In the first half, people learned the basic stack necessary to work towards a personal website, then deploying that site through GitHub pages. In the second half, students took in a series of lessons about Ruby syntax, but the underlying goal was to teach them the programming concepts common to a number of programming languages. Then, we shifted gears and had them work through a series of Rails tutorials that pushed them towards a real-life situation where they’re working through and on a thing (in this case a sort of platform for crowdsourcing transcriptions of images).
I really enjoyed teaching the Rails course, and I think there was a lot of good in it. But over the past few years it has raised a number of pedagogical questions for me:


What can you reasonably hope to teach in a week-long workshop?


Is it better to do more with less or less with more?


What is the upper-limit on the amount of new information students can take in during the week?


What will students actually use/remember from the course once the week is over?


To be fair, week-long workshops like this one often raise similar concerns for me. I had two main concerns about our course in particular.
The first was a question of audience. We got people of all different skill levels in the course. Some people were there to get going with programming for the first time. These newcomers often seemed really comfortable with the course during the first half, while the second half of the course could result in a lot of frustration when the difficulty of the material suddenly seemed to skyrocket. Other students were experienced developers with several languages under their belt who were there specifically to learn Rails. The first half of the course seemed to be largely review for this experienced group, while the second half was really what they were there to take on.  It’s great that we were able to pull in students with such diverse experiences, but I was especially concerned for the people new to programming who felt lost during the second half of the course. Those experienced folks looking to learn Rails? I think they can probably find their way into the framework some other way. But I didn’t want our course to turn people off from programming because the presentation of the material felt frustrating. We can fix that. I always feel as though we should be able to explain these methods to anyone, and I wanted our alumni to feel that they were empowered by their new experiences, not frustrated. I wanted our course to reflect that principle by focusing on this audience of people looking for an introduction, not an advanced tutorial.
I also wondered a lot about the outcomes of the course. I wondered how many of the students really did anything with web applications after the course was over. Those advanced students there specifically for Rails probably did, and I’m glad that they had tangible skills to walk away with. But, for the average person just getting into digital humanities programming, I imagine that Rails wasn’t something they were going to use right away. After all, you use what you need to do what you need. And, while Rails gives you a lot of options, it’s not necessarily the tool you need for the thing in front of you - specially when you’re starting out.
So we set about redesigning the course with some of these thoughts in mind and with a few principles:


Less is more.


A single audience is better than many.


If you won’t use it, you’ll lose it.


I wondered how we might redesign the course to better reflect the kinds of work that are most common to humanists using programming for their work. I sat down and thought about common tasks that I use programming for beyond building apps/web services. I made a list of some common tasks that, when they confront me, I go, “I can write a script for that!” The resulting syllabus is on the site, but I’ll reiterate it here. The main changes took place in the second half of the course:


Basics: command line, git, GitHub, HTML/CSS

Project: personal website



Programming concepts: Python

Project(s): Applied Python for acquiring, processing, and analyzing humanities data



The switch from Python to Ruby reflects, in part, my own changing practices, but I also find that the Pythonic syntax enforces good stylistic practices in learners. In place of working on a large Rails app, we keep the second half of the course focused on daily tasks that programming is good for. After learning the basic concepts from Python, we introduce a few case studies for applied Python. Like all our materials, these are available on our site. But I’d encourage interested folks to check out the Jupyter notebooks for these units if you’re interested. These are the new units on applications of Python to typical situations:


Working with CSV files


Getting data from API’s


Introduction to Web Scraping


Basic Text Analysis


In the process of working through these materials, the students work with real, live humanities data drawn from Project Gutenberg, the DPLA, and the Jack the Ripper Casebook. We walk the students through a few different options for building a corpus of data and working with it. After gathering data, we talk about problems with it and how to use it. Of course, you could run an entire course on such things. Our goal here is not to cover everything. In fact, I erred on the side of keeping the lessons relatively lightweight, with the assumption that the jump in difficulty level would require us to move pretty slowly. The main goal is to show how situations that appear to be much more complicated still boil down to the same basic concepts the students have just learned. We want to shrink the perceived gap between those beginning exercises and the kinds of scripts that are actually useful for your own day-to-day work. We introduce some slightly more advanced concepts along the way, but hopefully enough of the material will remain familiar that the students can excel. Ideally, the concepts we work through in these case studies will be more immediately useful to someone trying to introduce programming into their workflow for the first time. And, in being more immediately useful, the exercises might be more likely to give a lasting foundation for them to keep building on into the future.
We’ve also rebranded the course slightly. The course description has changed, as we’ve attempted to soften jargon and make it clear that students are meant to come to the course not knowing the terms or technologies in the description (they’re going to learn them with us!). The course name has changed as well, first as a joke but then in a serious way. Instead of simply being called “Humanities Programming,” the course is now “Help! I’m a Humanist! - code for Humanists with Python.” The goal there is to expose the human aspect of the course - no one is born knowing this stuff, and learning it means dealing with a load of tough feelings: anxiety, frustration, imposter syndrome, etc. I wanted to foreground all of this right away by making my own internal monologue part of the course title. The course can’t alleviate all those feelings, but I hoped to make it clear that we’re taking them into account and thinking about the human side of what it means to teach and learn this material. We’re in it together.
So. What can you do in a week? Quite a lot. What should you do - that’s a much tougher question. I’ve timed this post to go out right around when HILT starts. If I figure it out in the next week I’ll let you know.

I’ve accepted a new position as the Head of Graduate Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, and I’ll be transitioning into that role over the next few weeks! As a part of the interview process, we had to give a job talk. While putting together this presentation, I was lucky enough to have past examples to work from (as you’ll be able to tell, if you check out this past job talk by Amanda Visconti). Since my new position will involve helping graduate students through the process of applying for positions like these, it only feels right that I should post my own job talk as well as a few words on the thinking that went into it. Blemishes, jokes, and all, hopefully these materials will help someone in the future find a way in, just as the example of others did for me. And if you’re looking for more, Visconti has a great list of other examples linked from her more recent job talk for the Scholars’ Lab.
For the presentation, I was asked to respond to this prompt:

What does a student (from undergraduate to doctoral levels) need to learn or experience in order to add “DH” to his or her skill set? Is that an end or a means of graduate education? Can short-term digital assignments in discipline-specific courses go beyond “teaching with technology”? Why not refer everyone to online tutorials? Are there risks for doctoral students or the untenured in undertaking digital projects? Drawing on your own experience, and offering examples or demonstrations of digital research projects, pedagogical approaches, or initiatives or organizations that you admire, make a case for a vision of collaborative education in advanced digital scholarship in the arts and humanities.

I felt that each question could be a presentation all its own, and I had strong opinions about each one. Dealing with all of them seemed like a tall order. I decided to spend the presentation close reading and deconstructing that first sentence, taking apart the idea that education and/or digital humanities could be thought of in terms of lists of skills at all. Along the way, my plan was to dip into the other questions as able, but I also assumed that I would have plenty of time during the interview day to give my thoughts on them. I also wanted to try to give as honest a sense as possible of the way I approach teaching and mentoring. For me, it’s all about people and giving them the care that they need. In conveying that, I hoped, I would give the sort of vision the prompt was asking for. I also tried to sprinkle references to the past and present of the Scholars’ Lab programs to ground the content of the talk. When I mention potential career options in the body of the talk, I am talking about specific alumni who came through the fellowship programs. And when I mention graduate fellows potentially publishing on their work with the Twitter API, well, that’s not hypothetical either.
So below find the lightly edited text of the talk I gave at the Scholars’ Lab - “In, Out, Across, With: Collaborative Education and Digital Humanities.” I’ve only substantively modified one piece - swapping out one example for another.
And a final note on delivery: I have heard plenty of people argue over whether it is better to read a written talk or deliver one from notes. My own sense is that the latter is far more common for digital humanities talks. I have seen both fantastic read talks and amazing extemporaneous performances, just as I have seen terrible versions of each. My own approach is, increasingly, to write a talk but deliver that talk more or less from memory. In this case, I had a pretty long commute to work, so I recorded myself reading the talk and listened to it a lot to get the ideas in my head. When I gave the presentation, I had the written version in front of me for reference, but I was mostly moving through my own sense of how it all fit together in real time (and trying to avoid looking at the paper). My hope is that this gave me the best of both worlds and resulted in a structured but engaging performance. Your mileage may vary!
In, Out, Across, With: Collaborative Education and Digital Humanities
 
It’s always a treat to be able to talk with the members of the UVA Library community, and I am very grateful to be here. For those of you that don’t know me, I am Brandon Walsh, Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor of English at Washington and Lee University. The last time I was here, I gave a talk that had almost exclusively animal memes for slides. I can’t promise the same robust Internet culture in this talk, but talk to me after and I can hook you up. I swear I’ve still got it.
 
In the spirit of Amanda Visconti, the resources that went into this talk (and a number of foundational materials on the subject) can all be found in a Zotero collection at the above link. I’ll name check any that are especially relevant, but hopefully this set of materials will allow the thoughts in the talk to flower outwards for any who are interested in seeing its origins and echoes in the work of others.
 
And a final prefatory note: no person works, thinks or learns alone, so here are the names of the people in my talk whose thinking I touch upon as well as just some – but not all – of my colleagues at W&L who collaborate on the projects I mention. Top tier consists of people I cite or mention, second tier is for institutions or publications important to discussion, and final tier is for direct collaborators on this work.
Today I want to talk to you about how best to champion the people involved in collaborative education in digital research. I especially want to talk about students. And when I mention “students” throughout this talk, I will mostly be speaking in the context of graduate students. But most of what I discuss will be broadly applicable to all newcomers to digital research. My talk is an exhortation to find ways to elevate the voices of people in positions like these to be contributors to professional and institutional conversations from day one and to empower them to define the methods and the outcomes of the digital humanities that we teach. This means taking seriously the messy, fraught, and emotional process of guiding students through digital humanities methods, research, and careers. It means advocating for the legibility of this digital work as a key component of their professional development. And it means enmeshing these voices in the broader network around them, the local context that they draw upon for support and that they can enrich in turn. I believe it is the mission of the Head of Graduate Programs to build up this community and facilitate these networks, to incorporate those who might feel like outsiders to the work that we do. Doing so enriches and enlivens our communities and builds a better and more diverse research and teaching agenda.

This talk is titled “In, Out, Across, With: Collaborative Education and Digital Humanities,” and I’ll really be focusing on the prepositions of my title as a metaphor for the nature of this sort of position. I see this role as one of connection and relation. The talk runs about 24 minutes, so we should have plenty of time to talk.
When discussing digital humanities education, it is tempting to first and foremost discuss what, exactly, it is that you will be teaching. What should the students walk away knowing? To some extent, just as there is more than one way to make breakfast, you could devise numerous baseline curricula. 

This is what we came up with at Washington and Lee for students in our undergraduate digital humanities fellowship program. We tried to hit a number of kinds of skills that a practicing digital humanist might need. It’s by no means exhaustive, but the list is a way to start. We don’t expect one person to come away knowing everything, so instead we aim for students to have an introduction to a wide variety of technologies by the end of a semester or year. They’ll encounter some technologies applicable to project management, some to front-end design, as well as a variety of programming concepts broadly applicable to a variety of situations. Lists like this give some targets to hit. But still, even as someone who helped put this list together, it makes me worry a bit. I can imagine younger me being afraid of it! It’s easy for us to forget what it was like to be new, to be a beginner, to be learning for the first time, but I’d like to return us to that frame of thinking. I think we should approach lists like these with care, because they can be intimidating for the newcomer. So in my talk today I want to argue against lists of skills as ways of thinking.
I don’t mean to suggest that programs need no curriculum, nor do I mean to suggest that no skills are necessary to be a digital humanist. But I would caution against focusing too much on the skills that one should have at the end of a program, particularly when talking about people who haven’t yet begun to learn. I would wager that many people on the outside looking in think of DH in the same way: it’s a big list of unknowns. I’d like to get away from that.
Templates like this are important for developing courses, fellowship, and degree-granting programs, but I worry that the goodwill in them might all too easily seem like a form of gatekeeping to a new student. It is easy to imagine telling a student that “you have to learn GitHub before you can work on this project.” It’s just a short jump from this to a likely student response - “ah sorry - I don’t know that yet.” And from there I can all too easily imagine the common refrain that you hear from students of all levels - “If I can’t get that, then it’s because I’m not a technology person.” From there - “Digital humanities must not be for me.”
Instead of building our curricula out of as-yet-unknown tool chains, I want to float, today, a vision of DH education as an introduction to a series of professional practices. Lists of skills might be ends but I fear they might foreclose beginnings.

Instead, I will float something more in line with that of the Scholarly Communication Institute (held here at UVA for a time), which outlined what they saw as the needs of graduate and professional students in the digital age. I’ll particularly draw upon their first point here (last of my slides with tons of text, I swear): graduate students need training in “collaborative modes of knowledge production and sharing.”
I want to think about teaching DH as introducing a process of discovery that collapses hierarchies between expert and newcomer: that’s a way to start. This sort of framing offers digital humanities not as a series of methods one does or does not know, but, rather, as a process that a group can engage in together. Do they learn methods and skills in the process? Of course! Anyone who has taken part in the sort of collaborative group projects undertaken by the Scholars’ Lab comes away knowing more than they came in with. But I want to continue thinking about process and, in particular, how that process can be more inclusive and more engaging. By empowering students to choose what they want to learn and how they want to learn it, we can help to expand the reach of our work and better serve our students as mentors and collaborators. There are a few different in ways in which I see this as taking place, and they’ll form the roadmap for the rest of the talk. 
 
Apologies - this looks like the sort of slide you would get at a business retreat. All the same - we need to adapt and develop new professional opportunities for our students at the same time that we plan flexible outcomes for our educational programs. These approaches are meant to serve increasingly diverse professional needs in a changing job market, and they need to be matched by deepening support at the institutional level.
So to begin. One of our jobs as mentors is to encourage students to seek out professionally legible opportunities early on in their careers, and as shapers of educational programs we can go further and create new possibilities for them. At W&L, we have been collaborating with the Scholars’ Lab to bring UVA graduate students to teach short-form workshops on digital research in W&L classrooms. Funded opportunities like this one can help students professionalize in new ways and in new contexts while paying it forward to the nearby community. A similar initiative at W&L that I’ve been working on has our own library faculty and undergraduate fellows visiting local high schools to speak with advanced AP computer science students about how their own programming work can apply to humanities disciplines. I’m happy to talk more about these in Q&A.

We also have our student collaborators present at conferences, both on their own work and on work they have done with faculty members, both independently and as co-presenters. Here is Abdur, one of our undergraduate Mellon DH fellows, talking about the writing he does for his thesis and how it is enriched by and different from the writing he does in digital humanities contexts at the Bucknell Digital Scholarship Conference last fall. While this sort of thing is standard for graduate students, it’s pretty powerful for an undergraduate to present on research in this way. Learning that it’s OK to fail in public can be deeply empowering, and opportunities like these encourage our students to think about themselves as valuable contributors to ongoing conversations long before they might otherwise feel comfortable doing so.
But teaching opportunities and conferences are not the only ways to get student voices out there. I think there are ways of engaging student voices earlier, at home, in ways that can fit more situations. We can encourage students to engage in professional conversations by developing flexible outcomes in which we are equal participants. One approach to this with which I have been experimenting is group writing, which I think is undervalued as a taught skill and possible approach to DH pedagogy. An example: when a history faculty member at W&L approached the library (and by extension, me) for support in supplementing an extant history course with a component about digital text analysis, we could have agreed to offer a series of one-off workshops and be done with it.

Instead, this faculty member – Professor Sarah Horowitz – and I decided to collaborate on a more extensive project together, producing Introduction to Text Analysis: A Coursebook. The idea was to put the materials for the workshops together ahead of time, in collaboration, and to narrativize them into a set of lessons that would persist beyond a single semester as a kind of publication. The pedagogical labor that we put into reshaping her course could become, in some sense, professionally legible as a series of course modules that others could use beyond the term. So for the book, we co-authored a series of units on text analysis and gave feedback on each other’s work, editing and reviewing as well as reconfiguring them for the context of the course. Professor Horowitz provided more of the discipline-specific material that I could not, and I provided the materials more specific to the theories and methods of text analysis. Neither one of us could have written the book without the other.
Professor Horowitz was, in effect, a student in this moment. She was also a teacher and researcher. She was learning at the same time that she produced original scholarly contributions. Even as we worked together, for me this collaborative writing project was also a pedagogical experiment that drew upon the examples of Robin DeRosa, Shawn Graham, and Cathy Davidson, in particular. 
 
Davidson taught a graduate course on “21st Century Literacies” where each of her students wrote a chapter that was then collected and published as an open-access book. For us as for Davidson, the process of knowing, the process of uncovering is something that happens together. In public. And it’s documented so that others can benefit. Our teaching labor could become visible and professionally legible, as could the labor that Professor Horowitz put into learning new research skills. As she adapts and tries out ideas, and as we coalesce them into a whole, the writing product is both the means and the end of an introduction to digital humanities.
Professor Horowitz also wanted to learn technical skills herself, and she learned quite a lot through the writing process. Rather than sitting through lectures or being directed to online tutorials by me, I thought she would learn better by engaging with and shaping the material directly. Her course and my materials would be better for it, as she would be helping to bind my lectures and workshops to her course material. The process would also require her to engage with a list of technologies for digital publishing.
 
Beyond the text analysis materials and concepts, the process exposed her to a lot of technologies: command line, Markdown, Git for version control, GitHub for project management. In the process of writing this document, in fact, she covered most of the same curriculum as our undergraduate DH fellows.
 
She’s learning these things as we work together to produce course materials, but, importantly, the technical skills aren’t the focus of the work together. It’s a writing project! Rather than presenting the skills as ends in themselves, they were the means by which we were publishing a thing. They were immediately useful. And I think displacing the technology is helpful: it means that the outcomes and parameters for success are not based in the technology itself but, rather, in the thinking about and use of those methods. We also used a particular platform that allowed Professor Horowitz to engage with these technologies in a light way so that they would not overwhelm our work – I’m happy to discuss more in the time after if you’re interested.
This to say: the outcomes of such collaborative educations can be shaped to a variety of different settings and types of students. Take another model, CUNY’s Graduate Center Digital Fellows program, whose students develop open tutorials on digital tools. Learning from this example, rather than simply direct students or colleagues towards online tutorials like these, why not have them write their own documents, legible for their own positions, that synthesize and remix the materials that they already have found?
 
The learning process becomes something productive in this framing. I can imagine, for example, directing collaboratively authored materials by students like these towards something like The Programming Historian. If you’re not familiar, The Programming Historian offers a variety of lessons on digital humanities methods, and they only require an outline as a pitch to their editorial team, not a whole written publication ready to go. Your graduate students could, say, work with the Twitter API over the course of a semester, blog about the research outcomes, and then pitch a tutorial to The Programming Historian on the API as a result of their work. It’s much easier to motivate yourselves to write something if you know that the publication has already been accepted. Obviously such acceptance is not a given, but working towards a goal like this can offer student researchers something to aim for. Their instructors could co-author these materials, even, so that everyone has skin in the game.
This model changes the shape of what collaborative education can look like: it’s duration and its results. You don’t need a whole fellowship year. You could, in a reasonably short amount of time, tinker and play, and produce a substantial blog post, an article pitch, or a Library Research Guide (more on that in a moment).

As Jeff Jarvis has said, “we need to move students up the education chain.” And trust me - the irony of quoting a piece titled “Lectures are Bullshit” during a lecture to you is not lost on me. But stay with me.
Collaborative writing projects on DH topics are flexible enough to fit the many contexts for the kind of educational work that we do. After all, no one needs or values the same outcomes, and these shared and individual goals need to be worked out in conversation with the students themselves early on. Articulating these desires in a frank, written, and collaborative mode early on (in the genre of the project charter), can help the program directors to better shape the work to fit the needs of the students. But I also want to suggest that collaborative writing projects can be useful end products as well as launching pads, as they can fit the shape of many careers. After all, students come to digital humanities for a variety of different reasons. Some might be aiming to bolster a research portfolio on the path to a traditional academic career. Others might be deeply concerned about the likelihood of attaining such a position and be looking for other career options. Others still might instead be colleagues interested in expanding their research portfolio or skillset but unable to commit to a whole year of work on top of their current obligations. Writing projects could speak to all these situations.
I see someone in charge of shaping graduate programs as needing to speak to these diverse needs. This person is both a steward of where students currently are – the goals and objectives they might currently have – as well as of where they might go – the potential lives they might (or might not!) lead. After all, graduate school, like undergraduate, is an enormously stressful time of personal and professional exploration. If we think simply about a student’s professional development as a process of finding a job, we overlook the real spaces in which help might be most desired. Frequently, those needs are the anxieties, stresses, and pressures of refashioning yourself as a professional. We should not be in the business of creating CV lines or providing lists of qualifications alone. We should focus on creating strong, well-adjusted professionals by developing ethical programs that guide them into the professional world by caring for them as people.
In the graduate context, this involves helping students deal with the academic job market in particular.
 
To me in its best form, this means helping students to look at their academic futures and see proliferating possibilities instead of a narrow and uncertain route to a single job, to paraphrase the work of Katina Rogers. A sprinkler rather than a pipeline, in her metaphor. As Rogers’s work, in particular, has shown, recent graduate students increasingly feel that, while they experienced strong expectations that they would continue in the professoriate, they received inadequate preparation for the many different careers they might actually go on to have. The Praxis Program and the Praxis Network are good examples of how to position digital humanities education as answers to these issues. Fellowship opportunities like these must be robust enough that they can offer experiences and outcomes beyond the purely technical, so that a project manager from one fellowship year can graduate with an MA and go into industry in a similar role just as well-prepared as a PhD student aiming to be a developer might go on to something entirely different. And the people working these programs must be prepared for the messy labor of helping students to realize that these are satisfactory, laudable professional goals.
It should be clear that this sort of personal and professional support is the work of more than just one person. One of the strengths of a digital humanities center embedded in a library like this one at UVA is that fellows have the readymade potential to brush up against a variety of career options that become revealed when peaking outside of their disciplinary silos: digital humanities developers and project manager positions, sure, but also metadata specialists, archivists, and more. I think this kind of cross-pollination should be encouraged: library faculty and staff have a lot to offer student fellows and vice versa. Developing these relationships brings the fellows further into the kinds of the work done in the library and introduces them to careers that, while they might require further study to obtain, could be real options.
To my mind the best fellowship programs are those fully aware of their institutional context and those that both leverage and augment the resources around them as they are able. We have been working hard on this at W&L. We are starting to institute a series of workshops led by the undergraduate fellows in consultation with the administrators of the fellowship program. The idea is that past fellows lead workshops for later cohorts on the technology they have learned, some of which we selectively open to the broader library faculty and staff. The process helps to solidify the student’s training – no better way to learn than to teach – but it also helps to expand the student community by retaining fellows as committed members. It also helps to fill out a student’s portfolio with a cv-ready line of teaching experience. This process also aims to build our own capacity within the library by distributing skills among a wider array of students, faculty, and staff. After all, student fellows and librarians have much they could learn from one another. I see the Head of Graduate Programs as facilitating such collaborations, as connecting the interested student with the engaged faculty/staff/librarian collaborator, inside their institution or beyond.
But we must not forget that we are asking students and junior faculty to do risky things by developing these new interests, by spending time and energy on digital projects, let alone presenting and writing on them in professional contexts. The biggest risk is that we ask them to do so without supporting them adequately. All the technical training in the world means little if that work is illegible and irrelevant to your colleagues or committee.
 
In the words of Kathleen Fitzpatrick, we ask these students to “do the risky thing,” but we must “make sure that someone’s got their back.” I see the Head of Graduate Programs as the key in coordinating, fostering, and providing such care.
Students and junior faculty need support – for technical implementation, sure – but they also need advocates – people who can vouch for the quality of their work and campaign on their behalf in the face of committees and faculty who might be otherwise unable to see the value of their work. Some of this can come from the library, from people able to put this work in the context of guidelines for the evaluation of digital scholarship. But some of this support and advocacy has to come from within their home departments. The question is really how to build up that support from the outside in. And that’s a long, slow process that occurs by making meaningful connections and through outreach programs. At W&L, we have worked to develop an incentive grant program, where we incentivize faculty members who might be new to digital humanities or otherwise skeptical to experiment with incorporating a digital project into their course. The result is a slow burn – we get maybe one or two new faculty each term trying something out. That might seem small, but it’s something, particularly at a small liberal arts college. This kind of slow evangelizing is key in helping the work done by digital humanists to be legible to everyone. Students and junior faculty need advocates for their work in and out of the library and their home departments, and the person in this position is tasked with overseeing such outreach.
So, to return to the opening motif, lists of skillsets certainly have their place as we bring new people into the ever-expanding field: they’re necessary. They reflect a philosophy and a vision, and they’re the basis of growing real initiatives. But it’s the job of the Head of Graduate Programs to make sure that we never lose sight of the people and relationships behind them.
Foremost, then, I see the Head of Graduate Programs as someone who takes the lists, documents, and curricula that I have discussed and connects them to the people that serve them and that they are meant to speak to. This person is one who builds relationships, who navigates the prepositions of my title.
 
It’s the job of such a person to blast the boundary between “you’re in” and “you’re out” so that the tech-adverse or shy student can find a seat at the table. This is someone who makes sure that the work of the fellows is represented across institutions and in their own departments. This person makes sure the fellows are well positioned professionally. This person builds up people and embeds them to networks where they can flourish. Their job is never to forget what it’s like to be the person trying to learn. Their job is to hear “I’m not a tech person” and answer “not yet, but you could be! and I know just the people to help. Let’s learn together.”

What follows is a slightly more fleshed out version of what I presented this past week at HASTAC 2016 (complete with my memory-inflected transcript of the Q&A). I gave a bit more context for the project at the event than I do here, so it might be helpful to read my past two posts on the project here and here before going forward. This talk continues that conversation.]
This year in the Scholar’s Lab I have been working with Eric on a machine learning project that studies speech in Virginia Woolf’s fiction. I have written elsewhere about the background for the project and initial thoughts towards its implications. For the purposes of this blog post, I will just present a single example to provide context. Consider the famous first line of Mrs. Dalloway:

Mrs Dalloway said, “I will buy the flowers myself.”

Nothing to remark on here, except for the fact that this is not how the sentence actually comes down to us. I have modified it from the original:

Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.

My project concerns moments like these, where Woolf implies the presence of speech without marking it as such with punctuation. I have been working with Eric to lift such moments to the surface using computational methods so that I can study them more closely.
I came to the project by first tagging such moments myself as I read through the text, but I quickly found myself approaching upwards of a hundred instances in a single novel-far too many for me to keep track of in any systematic way. What’s more, the practice made me aware of just how subjective my interpretation could be. Some moments, like this one, parse fairly well as speech. Others complicate distinctions between speech, narrative, and thought and are more difficult to identify. I became interested in the features of such moments. What is it about speech in a text that helps us to recognize it as such, if not for the quotation marks themselves? What could we learn about sound in a text from the ways in which it structures such sound moments?
These interests led me towards a particular kind of machine learning, supervised classification, as an alternate means of discovering similar moments. For those unfamiliar with the concept, an analogy might be helpful. As I am writing this post on a flight to HASTAC and just finished watching a romantic comedy, these are the tools that I will work with. Think about the genre of the romantic comedy. I only know what this genre is by virtue of having seen my fair share of them over the course of my life. Over time I picked up a sense of the features associated with these films: a serendipitous meeting leads to infatuation, things often seem resolved before they really are, and the films often focus on romantic entanglements more than any other details. You might have other features in mind, and not all romantic comedies will conform to this list. That’s fine: no one’s assumptions about genre hold all of the time. But we can reasonably say that, the more romantic comedies I watch, the better my sense of what a romantic comedy is. My chances of being able to watch a movie and successfully identify it as conforming to this genre will improve with further viewing. Over time, I might also be able to develop a sense of how little or how much a film departs from these conventions.
Supervised classification works on a similar principle. By using the proper tools, we can feed a computer program examples of something in order to have it later identify similar objects. For this project, this process means training the computer to recognize and read for speech by giving it examples to work from. By providing examples of speech occurring within quotation marks, we can teach the program when quotation marks are likely to occur. By giving it examples of what I am calling ‘implied speech,’ it can learn how to identify those as well.
For this machine learning project, I analyzed Woolf texts downloaded from Project Gutenberg. Eric and I put together scripts in Python 3 that used a package known as the Natural Language Toolkit] for classifying. All of this work can be found at the project’s GitHub repository.
The project is still ongoing, and we are still working out some difficulties in our Python scripts. But I find the complications of the process to be compelling in their own right. For one, when working in this way we have to tell the computer what features we want it to pay attention to: a computer does not intuitively know how to make sense of the examples that we want to train it on. In the example of romantic comedies, I might say something along the lines of “while watching these films, watch out for the scenes and dialogue that use the word ‘love.’” We break down the larger genre into concrete features that can be pulled out so that the program knows what to watch out for.
To return to Woolf, punctuation marks are an obvious feature of interest: the author suggests that we have shifted into the realm of speech by inserting these grammatical markings. Find a quotation mark-you are likely to be looking at speech. But I am interested in just those moments where we lose those marks, so it helps to develop a sense of how they might work. We can then begin to extrapolate those same features to places where the punctuation marks might be missing. We have developed two models for understanding speech in this way: an external and an internal model. To illustrate, I have taken a single sentence and bolded what the model takes to be meaningful features according to each model. Each represents a different way of thinking about how we recognize something as speech.
External Model for Speech:

“I love walking in London,” said Mrs. Dalloway.  ”Really it’s better than walking in the country.”

The external model was our initial attempt to model speech. In it, we take an interest in the narrative context around quotation marks. In any text, we can say that there exist a certain range of keywords that signal a shift into speech: said, recalled, exclaimed, shouted, whispered, etc. Words like these help the narrative attribute speech to a character and are good indicators that speech is taking place. Given a list of words like this, we could reasonably build a sense of the locations around which speech is likely to be happening. So when training the program on this model, we had the classifier first identify locations of quotation marks. Around each quotation mark, the program took note of the diction and parts of speech that occurred within a given distance from the marking. We build up a sense of the context around speech.
Internal Model for Speech:

“I love walking in London,” said Mrs. Dalloway. “Really it’s better than walking in the country.”

The second model we have been working with works in an inverse direction: instead of taking an interest in the surrounding context of speech, an internal model assumes that there are meaningful characteristics within the quotation itself. In this example, we might notice that the shift to the first-person ‘I’ is a notable feature in a text that is otherwise largely written in the third person. This word suggests a shift in register. Each time this model encounters a quotation mark it continues until it finds a second quotation mark. The model then records the diction and parts of speech inside the pair of markings.
Each model suggests a distinct but related understanding for how sound works in the text. When I set out on this project, I had aimed to use the scripts to give me quantifiable evidence for moments of implied speech in Woolf’s work. The final step in this process, after all, is to actually use these models to identify speech: looking at texts they haven’t seen before, the scripts insert a caret marker every time they believe that a quotation mark should occur. But it quickly became apparent that the construction of the algorithms to describe such moments would be at least as interesting as any results that the project could produce. In the course of constructing them, I have had to think about the relationships among sound, text, and narrative in new ways.
The algorithms are each interpretative in the sense that they reflect my own assumptions about my object of study. The models also reflect assumptions about the process of reading, how it takes place, and about how a reader converts graphic markers into representations of sound. In this sense, the process of preparing for and executing text analysis reflects a certain phenomenology of reading as much as it does a methodology of digital study. The scripting itself is an object of inquiry in its own right and reflects my own interpretation of what speech can be. These assumptions are worked and reworked as I craft algorithms and python scripts, all of which are as shot through with humanistic inquiry and interpretive assumptions as any close readings.
For me, such revelations are the real reasons for pursuing digital study: attempting to describe complex humanities concepts computationally helps me to rethink basic assumptions about them that I had taken for granted. In the end, the pursuit of an algorithm to describe textual speech is nothing more or less than the pursuit of deeper and enriched theories of text and speech themselves.
Postscript
I managed to take note of the questions I got when I presented this work at HASTAC, so what follows are paraphrases of my memory of them as well as some brief remarks that roughly reflect what I said in the moment. There may have been one other that I cannot quite recall, but alas such is the fallibility of the human condition.
Q: You distinguish between speech and implied speech, but do you account at all for the other types of speech in Woolf’s novels? What about speech that is remembered speech that happened in earlier timelines not reflected in the present tense of the narrative’s events?
A: I definitely encountered this during my first pass at tagging speech and implied speech in the text by hand. Instead of binaries like quoted speech/implied speech, I found myself wanting to mark for a range of speech types: present, actual; remembered, might not have happened; remembered incorrectly; remembered, implied; etc. I decided that a binary was more feasible for the machine learning problems that I was interested in, but the whole process just reinforced how subjective any reading process is: another reader might mark things differently. If these processes shape the construction of the theories that inform the project, then they necessarily also affect the algorithms themselves as well as the results they can produce. And it quickly becomes apparent that these decisions reflect a kind of phenomenology of reading as much as anything: they illlustrate my understanding of how a complicated set of markers and linguistic phenomenon contribute to our understanding that a passage is speech or not.
Q: Did you encounter any variations in the particular markings that Woolf was using to punctuate speech? Single quotes, etc., and how did you account for them?
A: Yes - the version of Orlando that I am working with used single quotes to notate speech. So I was forced to account for such edge cases. But the question points at two larger issues: one authorial and one bibliographical. As I worked on Woolf I was drawn to the idea of being able to run such a script against a wider corpus. Since the project seemed to impinging on how we also understand psychologized speech, it would be fascinating to be able to search for implied speech in other authors. But, if you are familiar with, say, Joyce, you might remember that he hated quotation marks and used dashes to denote speech. The question is how much can you account for such edge cases, and, if not, the study becomes only one of a single author’s idiosyncrasies (which still has value). But from there the question spirals outwards. At least one of my models (the internal one) relies on quotation marks themselves as boundary markers. The model assumes that quotation marks will come in pairs, and this is not always the case. Sometimes authors, intentionally or accidentally, omit a closing quotation mark. I had to massage the data in at least half a dozen places where there was no quotation mark in the text and where its lack was causing my program to fail entirely. As textual criticism has taught us, punctuation marks are the single most likely things to be modified over time during the process of textual transmission by scribes, typesetters, editors, and authors. So in that sense, I am not doing a study of Woolf’s punctuation so much as a study of Woolf’s punctuation in these particular versions of the texts. One can imagine an exhaustive study that works on all versions of all Woolf’s texts as a study that might approach some semblance of a correct and thorough reading. For this project, however, I elected to take the lesser of two evils that would still allow me to work through the material. I worked with the texts that I had. I take all of this as proof that you have to know your corpus and your own shortcomings in order to responsibly work on the materials - such knowledge helps you to validate your responses, question your results, and reframe your approaches.
Q: You talked a lot about text approaching sound, but what about the other way around - how do things like implied speech get reflected in audiobooks, for example? Is there anything in recordings of Woolf that imply a kind of punctuation that you can hear?
A: I wrote about this extensively in my dissertation, but for here I will just say that I think the textual phenomenon the questioner is referencing occurs on a continuum. Some graphic markings, like pictures, shapes, punctuation marks, do not clearly translate to sound. And the reverse is true: the sounded quality of a recording can only ever be remediated by a print text. There are no perfect analogues between different media forms. Audiobook performers might attempt to convey things like punctuation or implied speech (in the audiobook of Ulysses, for example, Jim Norton throws his voice and lowers his volume to suggest free indirect discourse). In the end, I think such moments are playing with an idea of what my dissertation calls audiotextuality, the idea that all texts recordings of texts, to varying degrees, contain both sound and print elements. The two spheres may work in harmony or against each other as a kind of productive friction. The idea is a slippery one, but I think it speaks to moments like the implied punctuation mark that come through in a particularly powerful audiobook recording.

This year I am working with Eric Rochester on a fellowship project that has me learning natural language processing (NLP), the application of computational methods to human languages. We’re adapting these techniques to study quotation marks in the novels of Virginia Woolf (read more about the project here). We actually started several months before this academic year began, and, as we close out another semester, I have been spending time thinking about just what has made it such an effective learning experience for me. I already had a technical background from my time in the Scholars’ Lab at the beginning of the process, but I had no experience with Python or NLP. Now I feel most comfortable with the former of any other programming language and familiar enough with the latter to experiment with it in my own work.
The general mode of proceeding has been this: depending on schedules and deadlines, we meet once or twice every two weeks. Between our meetings I would work as far and as much as I could, and the sessions would offer a space for Eric and me to talk about what I had done. The following are a handful of things we have done that, I think, have helped to create such an effective environment for learning new technical skills. Though they are particular to this study, I think they can be usefully extrapolated to apply to many other project-based courses of study in digital humanities. They are primarily written from the perspective of a student but with an eye to how and why the methods Eric used proved so effective for me.
Let the Wheel Be Reinvented Before Sharing Shortcuts
I came to Eric with a very small program adapted from Matt Jockers’s book on_ Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature_ that did little beyond count quotation marks and give some basic statistics. I was learning as I built the thing, so I was unaware that I was reinventing the wheel in many cases, rebuilding many protocols for dealing with commonly recognized problems that come from working with natural language. After working on my program and my approach to a degree of satisfaction, Eric pulled back the curtain to reveal that a commonly used python module, the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), could address many of my issues and more. NLTK came as something of a revelation, and working inductively in this way gave me a great sense of the underlying problems the tools could address. By inventing my own way to read in a text, clean it to make its text uniformly readable by the computer, and breaking the whole piece into a series of words that could be analyzed, I understood the magic behind a couple lines of NLTK code that could do all that for me. The experience also helped me to recognize ways in which we would have to adapt NLTK for our own purposes as I worked through the book.
Have a Plan, but Be Flexible
After discussing NLTK and how it offered an easier way of doing the things that I wanted, Eric had me systematically work through the NLTK book for a few months. Our meetings took on the character of an independent study: the book set the syllabus, and I went through the first seven chapters at my own pace. Working from a book gave our meetings structure, but we were careful not to hew too closely to the material. Not all chapters were relevant to the project, and we cut sections of the book accordingly. We shaped the course of study to the intellectual questions rather than the other way around.
Move from Theory to Practice / Textbook to Project
As I worked through the book, I was able to recognize certain sections that felt most relevant to the Woolf work. Once I felt as though I had reached a critical mass, we switched from the book to the project itself and started working. I tend to learn from doing best, so the shift from theory to execution was a natural one. The quick and satisfying transition helped the work to feel productive right away: I was applying my new skills as I was still learning to feel comfortable with them. Where the initial months had more the feel of a traditional student-teacher interaction, the project-based approach we took up at this point felt more like a real and true collaboration. Eric and I would develop to-do items together, we would work alongside each other, and we would talk over the project together.
Document Everything
Between our meetings I would work as far and as much as I could, carefully noting places at which I encountered problems. In some cases, these were conceptual problems that needed clarifying, and these larger questions frequently found their way into separate notes. But my questions were frequently about what a particular line of code, a particular command or function, might be doing. In that case, I made comments directly in the code describing my confusion. I quickly found that these notes were as much for me as for Eric–I needed to get back in the frame of mind that led to the confusion in the first place, and copious notes helped remind me what the problem was. These notes offered a point of departure for our meetings: we always had a place to start, and we did so based on the work that I had done.
Communicate in as Many Ways as Possible
We met in person as much as possible, but we also used a variety of other platforms to keep things moving. Eric and I had all of our code on GitHub so that we could share everything that we had each been working on and discuss things from a distance if necessary. Email, obviously, can do a lot, but I found the chat capabilities of the Scholars’ Lab’s IRC channel to be far better for this sort of work. If I hit a particular snag that would only require a couple minutes for Eric to answer, we could quickly work things out through a web chat. With Skype and Google Hangouts we could even share the code on the other person’s computer even from hundreds of miles away. All of these things meant that we could keep working around whatever life events happened to call us away.
Recognize Spinning Wheels
These multiple avenues of communication are especially important when teaching technical skills. Not all questions or problems are the same: students can work through some on their own, but others can take them days to troubleshoot. Some amount of frustration is a necessary part of learning, and I do think it’s necessary that students learn to confront technical problems on their own. But not all frustration is pedagogically productive. There comes a point when you have tried a dozen potential solutions and you feel as though you have hit a wall. An extra set of eyes can (and should) help. Eric and I talked constantly about how to recognize when it was time for me to ask for help, and low-impact channels of communication like IRC could allow him to give me quick fixes to what, to me at least, seemed like impossible problems. Software development is a collaborative process, and asking for help is an important skill for humanists to develop.
In-person Meetings Can Take Many Forms
When we met, Eric and I did a lot of different things. First, we would talk through my questions from the previous week. If I felt a particular section of code was clunky or poorly done, he would talk and walk me through rewriting the same piece in a more elegant form. We would often pair program, where Eric would write code while I watched, carefully stopping him each time I had a question about something he was doing. And we often took time to reflect on where the collaboration was going - what my end goal was as well as what my tasks before the next meeting would be. Any project has many pieces that could be dealt with at any time, and Eric was careful to give me solo tasks that he felt I could handle on my own, reserving more difficult tasks for times in which we would be able to work together. All of this is to say that any single hour we spent together was very different from the last. We constantly reinvented what the meetings looked like, which kept them fresh and pedagogically effective.
This is my best attempt to recreate my experience of working in such a close mentoring relationship with Eric. Obviously, the collaboration relies on an extremely low student-to-teacher ratio: I can imagine this same approach working very well for a handful of students, but this work required a lot of individual attention that would be hard to sustain for larger classes. One idea for scaling the process up might be to divide a course into groups, being training one, and then have students later in the process begin to mentor those who are just beginning. Doing so would preserve what I see as the main advantage of this approach: it helps to collapse the hierarchy between student and teacher and engage both in a common project. Learning takes place, but it does so in the context of common effort. I’d have to think more about how this mentorship model could be adapted to fit different scenarios. The work with Eric is ongoing, but it’s already been one of the most valuable learning experiences I have had.

For the last couple weeks, I have been exploring APIs useful to sound studies for a sound recording and poetry project I am working on with former Scholars’ Lab fellow Annie Swafford. I was especially drawn to playing around with Spotify, which has an API that allows you to access metadata for the large catalog of music available through their service. The experiment described below focuses on genre: a notoriously messy category that we nonetheless rely on to tell us how to process the materials we read, view, or hear. Genre tells us what to expect from the art we take in, and our construction and reception of generic categories can tell us a lot about ourselves. In music, especially, genres and subgenres can activate fierce debates about authenticity and belonging. Does your favorite group qualify as “authentic” jazz? What composers do you have to know in order to think of yourself as a real classical music aficionado? Playing with an artist’s metadata can expose a lot of the assumptions that were made in its collection, and I was especially interested in the ways in which Spotify models relations among artists.
I wanted to explore Spotify’s metadata in a way that would model the interpretive messiness of generic categories. To do so, I built a program that bounces through Spotify’s metadata to produce multiple readings of the idea of genre in relation to a particular artist. Spotify offers a fairly robust API, and there are a number of handy wrappers that make it easier to work with. I used a Python module called Spotipy for the material below, and you can find the code for my little genre experiment over on my GitHub page. If you do try to run this on your own machine, note that you will need to clone Spotipy’s repository and manually install it from the terminal with the following command from within the downloaded repository:
$ python setup.py install
Pip will install an older distribution of the code that will only run in Python 2, but Spotipy’s GitHub page has a more recent release that is compatible with Python 3.
When run, the program outputs what I like to think of as the equivalent of music nerds arguing over musical genres. You provide an artist name and a number, and the terminal will work through Spotify’s API to produce the specified number of individual “mappings” of that artist’s genre as well as an aggregate list of all their associated genres. The program starts by pulling out all the genre categories associated with the given artist as well as those given to artists that Spotify flags as related. Once finished, the program picks one of those related artists at random and continues to do the same until the process returns no new genre categories, building up a list of associated genres over time.
So, in short, you give the program an artist and it offers you a few attempts at describing that artist generically using Spotify’s catalog, the computational equivalent of instigating an argument about genre in your local record store. Here are the results for running the program three times for the band New Order:

Individual genre maps
Just one nerd's opinions on New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'new romantic', 'new wave pop', 'hi nrg', 'europop', 'power pop', 'album rock']
Just one nerd's opinions on New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'gothic metal', 'j-metal', 'visual kei', 'intelligent dance music', 'uk post-punk', 'metropopolis', 'ambient', 'big beat', 'electronic', 'illbient', 'piano rock', 'trance', 'progressive house', 'progressive trance', 'uplifting trance', 'quebecois', 'deep uplifting trance', 'garage rock', 'neo-psychedelic', 'space rock', 'japanese psychedelic']
Just one nerd's opinions on New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'uk post-punk', 'gothic rock', 'discofox', 'madchester', 'britpop', 'latin', 'latin pop', 'teen pop', 'classic colombian pop', 'rai', 'pop rap', 'southern hip hop', 'trap music', 'deep rai']
Aggregate genre map for New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'new romantic', 'new wave pop', 'hi nrg', 'europop', 'power pop', 'album rock', 'gothic metal', 'j-metal', 'visual kei', 'intelligent dance music', 'uk post-punk', 'metropopolis', 'ambient', 'big beat', 'electronic', 'illbient', 'piano rock', 'trance', 'progressive house', 'progressive trance', 'uplifting trance', 'quebecois', 'deep uplifting trance', 'garage rock', 'neo-psychedelic', 'space rock', 'japanese psychedelic', 'gothic rock', 'discofox', 'madchester', 'britpop', 'latin', 'latin pop', 'teen pop', 'classic colombian pop', 'rai', 'pop rap', 'southern hip hop', 'trap music', 'deep rai']

In each case, the genre maps all begin the same, with the categories directly assigned to the source artist. Because the process is slightly random, the program eventually maps the same artist’s genre differently each time. For each iteration, the program runs until twenty randomly selected related artists return no new genre categories, which I take to be a kind of threshold of completion for one understanding of an artist’s genre.
The results suggest an amalgam of generic influence, shared characteristics, common lineages, and overlapping angles of approach. The decisions I made in how the program interacts with Spotify’s metadata suggest a definition of genre like the one offered by Alastair Fowler: “Representatives of a genre may then be regarded as making up a family whose septs and individual members are related in various ways, without necessarily having any single feature shared in common by all” (41). Genre is fluid and a matter of interpretive opinion - it is not necessarily based on objective links. The program reflects this in its results: sometimes a particular generic mapping feels very coherent, while at other times the script finds its way to very bizarre tangents. The connections do exist in the metadata if you drill down deeply enough, and it is possible to reproduce the links that brought about such output. But the more leaps the program takes from the original artist the more tenuous the connections appear to be. As I wrote this sentence, the program suggested a connection between garage rock revivalists The Strokes and big band jazz music: such output looks less like a conversation among music nerds and more like the material for a Ph.D. dissertation. As the program illustrates, generic description is the beginning of interpretation - not the ending.
Of course, the program does not actually search all music ever: it only has access to the metadata for artists listed in Spotify, and some artists like Prince or the Beatles are notoriously missing from the catalog. Major figures like these have artist pages that serve as stubs for content drawn largely from compilation CDs, and the program can successfully crawl through these results. But this wrinkle points to a larger fact: the results the program produces are as skewed as the collection of musicians in the service’s catalog. Many of the errors I had to troubleshoot were related to the uneven nature of the catalog: early versions of the script were thrown into disarray when Spotify listed no related artists for a musician. On occasion, the API suggested a related artist who did not actually have an artist page in the system (often the case with new or less-established musicians). I massaged these gaps to make this particular exercise work (you’ll now get a tongue in cheek “Musical dead end” or “Artist deleted from Spotify” output for them), but the silences in the archive offer significant reminders of the commercial politics that go into generic and archival formation, particularly when an archive is proprietary. I can imagine tweaking things slightly to create a script that produces only those archival gaps, but that is work for another day. In the meantime, I’ll be trying to figure out how Kanye West might be considered Christmas music.

For my fellowship in the Scholars’ Lab this year I’ll be working with Eric to expand a project we began last year on Virginia Woolf and natural language processing. My dissertation focuses on sound recordings and modernism, and this year I will focus on how Woolf’s quotation marks offer evidence of her engagement with sound as a textual device. In my reading, the quotation mark is the most obvious point at which sound meets text, the most heavily used sound recording technology in use by writers. Patterns in quotation mark usage across large corpora can tell us a lot about the role that sound plays in literature, but, as you might expect, there are lots of quotation marks - hundreds or thousands in any given text. Computational methods can help us make sense of the vast number and turn them into reasonable objects of study.
You can find more information in this post about my thinking on quotation marks and some preliminary results from thinking about them in relation to Woolf. As I discuss there, finding quotation marks in a text is not especially challenging, but this year Eric and I will be focusing on a particular wrinkle in Woolf’s use of the marks, best conveyed in The Hours, Michael Cunningham’s late-century riff on Virginia Woolf. In The Hours, Cunningham offers a fictionalized version of Woolf meditating on her composition process:

She passes a couple, a man and woman younger than herself, walking together, leisurely, bent towards each other in the soft lemon-colored glow of a streetlamp, talking (she hears the man, “told me something something something in this establishment, something something, harrumph, indeed”) (166).

The repeated “somethings“ of the passage suggest the character’s imperfect experience of the conversation as well as the limits of her senses. As the moment is conveyed through the character’s perspective, the conversation will always be incomplete. Recording technology was largely unreliable during the early days of the twentieth century, and, similarly, the sound record of this conversation as given by the text is already degraded before we hear it. Cunningham points to how the sounded voice is given character in the ears of the listener, and, in a print context, in the pen of the writer. A printed voice can speak in a variety of ways and in a variety of modes.
Cunningham’s passage contains echoes of what will eventually be the famous first sentence of Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway: “Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.” The text implies that Mrs. Dalloway speaks, but it does not mark it as such: the same conversational tone in Cunningham remains here, but the narrator does not differentiate sound event from narrative by using quotation marks. We see moments of indirect speech like this all the time, when discourse becomes submerged in the texture of the narrative, but it doesn’t disappear entirely. Speech implies a lot: social relations, the thoughts of a speaking body, among others. Things get muddy when the line between narrative voice and speech becomes unclear. If quotation marks imply a different level of speech than unquoted speech, might they also imply changes in the social relations they represent?
Mrs. Dalloway is filled with moments like these, and this year I’ll be working to find ways to float them to the surface of the text. Examining these moments can tell us how conversation changes during the period, what people are talking about and for, how we conceive of the limits of print and sound, and about changing priorities in literary aesthetics. The goal this year is to train the computer to identify moments like this, moments that a human reader would be able to parse as spoken but that are not marked as such. Our first pass will be to work with the quoted material, which we can easily identify to build a series of trigger words that Woolf uses to flag speech as sound (said, asked, called, etc.). With this lexicon, we can then look for instances in her corpus where they pop up without punctuation. Teaching the computer to classify these passages correctly will be a big task, and this process alone will offer me lots of new material to work with as I untangle the relationship between modernist print and sound. In upcoming posts I’ll talk more about the process of learning natural language processing and about some preliminary results and problems. Stay tuned!

[This week I presented at the 2015 Huskey Research Exhibition at UVA. The talk was delivered from very schematic notes, but below is a rough recreation of what I discussed. The talk I gave is a crash course in a new project I’ve started working on with the generous help of the Scholars’ Lab that thinks about sound in Virginia Woolf’s career using computational methods. Eric Rochester, especially, has been endlessly giving of his time and expertise, helping me think through and prototype work on this material. The talk wound up receiving first prize for the digital humanities panel of which I was a part. The project is still very much inchoate, and I’d welcome thoughts on it.
When I talk to you, you make certain assumptions about me as a person based on what you’re hearing. You decide whether or not I might be worth paying attention to, and you develop a sense of our social relations based around the sound of my voice. The voice conveys and generates assumptions about the body and about power: am I making myself heard? Am I registering as a speaking voice? Am I worth listening to?

The human microphone, made famous by Occupy Wall Street, nicely encapsulates the social dimensions of sound that interest me: one person speaks, and the people around her repeat what she says more loudly, again and again, amplifying the human voice without technology. Sound literally moves through multiple bodies and structures the social relations between people, and the whole movement is an attempt to make a group of people heard by those who would rather not listen.
As a literary scholar, I am interested in how texts can speak in similar ways. The texts we read frequently contain large amounts of speech within them: conversations, monologues, poetic voice, etc. We talk about sound in texts all the time, and the same social and political dimensions of sound still remain even if a text appears silent on the page. If who can be heard and who gets to speak are both contested questions in the real world, they continue to structure our experiences of printed universes.
All of this brings me to the quotation mark. The humble piece of punctuation does a lot of work for us every day, and I want to think more closely about how it can help us understand how texts speak. The quotation mark is the most obvious point at which sound meets text. Computational methods tend to focus on the vocabulary of a text as the building blocks of meaning, but they can also help us turn quotation marks into objects of inquiry. Quotation marks can tell us a lot about how texts engage with the human voice, but there are lots of them in texts. Digital methods can help us make sense of the scale.

I examine Virginia Woolf’s quotation marks, in particular, for a number of reasons. Aesthetically, we can see her bridging the Victorian and modernist literary periods, though she tends to fall in with the latter of the two. Politically, she lived through periods of intense social and political upheaval at the beginning of the twentieth century. Very few recordings of Woolf remain, but she nonetheless thought deeply about sound recording. The worldwide market for gramophones exploded during her lifetime, and her texts frequently featured technologies of sound reproduction. Woolf’s gramophones frequently malfunction in her novels, and I’m interested in seeing how her quotation marks might analogously be irregular or broken intentionally. Woolf is especially good for thinking about punctuation marks in this way: she owned a printing press, and she often set type herself.
The following series of histograms gives a rough estimation of how Woolf’s use of quotation changes over the course of her career. On GitHub  you can find the script I’ve been working on with Eric to generate these results. The number of quotations is plotted on the y-axis against their position in the novel on the x-axis, so each histogram represents more quoted speech with higher bars and more concentrated darknesses. If you have an especially good understanding of a particular novel, Mrs. Dalloway, say, you could pick out moments of intense conversation based on sudden spikes in the number of quotations. The histograms are organized in such a way that to read chronologically through Woolf’s career you would read left to right line by line, as you would the text of a book. The top-left histogram is Woolf’s earliest novel, the bottom-right corner her last.
     
To my eye, the output suggests high concentrations of conversation in the novels at the beginning and ending of Woolf’s career. We can see that her middle period, especially, appears to have a significant decrease in the amount of quoted speech. In one sense, this might make sense to someone familiar with Woolf’s career. Her first two novels feel more typically Victorian in their aesthetics, and she really gets into the thick of modernist experiment with her third novel. One way we often describe the shift from Victorian to the modernist period is as a shift inward, away from society and towards the psychology of the self. So it makes sense that we might see the amount of conversation between multiple speaking bodies significantly fall away over the course of those novels. The seventh histogram is especially interesting, because it suggests the least amount of speech of anything in her corpus. But if we visualize things a different way, we see that this novel, The Waves, actually shows a huge spike in punctuated speech. This graph represents the percentage of each text that is contained within quotation marks, the amount of text represented as punctuated speech.

This might look like a problem with the data: how could the text with the fewest number of quotations also have the highest percentage of quoted speech? But the script is actually giving me exactly what I asked for: The Waves is a series of monologues by six disembodied voices, and the amount of non-speech text is extremely small. More generally, charting the percentage of quoted speech in the corpus appears to support my general readings of the original nine histograms: roughly three times as much punctuated speech in the early novels as in the middle period, with a slight leveling off in the end of her career.
We could think of The Waves as an anomaly, but I think it more clearly calls for a revision of such a reading of speech in Woolf’s career. The spike in quoted speech is a hint that there is something else going on in Woolf’s work. Perhaps we can use the example of The Waves to propose that there might be a range of discourses, of types of speech in Woolf’s corpus. Before I suggested that speech diminished in the middle of Woolf’s career, but that’s not exactly true. My suspicion is that it just enters a different mode. Consider these two passages, both quoted from Mrs. Dalloway:

Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. 
Times without number Clarissa had visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home. Was Evelyn ill again? Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome, perfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always, but presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend, Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify.

In each case, the text implies speech by Mrs. Dalloway and by Hugh without marking it as such with punctuation marks. Discourse becomes submerged in the texture of the narrative, but it doesn’t disappear entirely. Moments like these suggest a range of discourses in Woolf’s corpus: dialogue, monologue, conversation, punctuated, implied, etc. All of these speech types have different implications, but it’s difficult to get a handle on them because of their scale. I began the project by simply trying to mark down moments of implied speech in Mrs. Dalloway by hand. Once I got to about two hundred, it seemed like it was time to ask the computer for help.
The current plan moving forward is to build a corpus of test passages containing both quoted speech and implied speech, train a python script against this set of passages, and then use this same script to search for instances of implied speech throughout Woolf’s corpus. Theoretically, at least, the script will search for a series of words that flag text as implied speech to a human reader - said, recalled, exclaimed, etc. Using this lexicon as a basis, the script would then pull out the context surrounding these words to produce a database of sentences meant to serve as speech. At Eric’s suggestion, I’m currently exploring the Natural Language Toolkit to take a stab at all of this. My own hypothesis is that there will be an inverse relationship between quoted speech and implied speech in her corpus, that the amount of speech left unflagged by quotation marks will increase in the middle of Woolf’s career. Once I have all this material, I’ll be able to subject the results to further analysis and to think more deeply about speech in Woolf’s work. Who speaks? What about? What counts as a voice, and what is left in an ambiguous, unsounded state?
The project is very much in its beginning stages, but it’s already opening up the way that I think about speech in Woolf’s text. It tries to untangle the relationship between our print record and our sonic record, and further work will help show how discourse is unfolding over time in the modernist period.

I am pleased to announce that “Moving People, Linking Lives: An Interdisciplinary Symposium” will take place March 20-21, 2015 at the University of Virginia. Friday, March 20 events will take place in the Kaleidoscope Room. Saturday, March 21 events will take place in Alderman 421 except for an evening reception, location to be determined.
Presentations and workshops will open dialogue across different fields, periods, and methods, from textual interpretation to digital research. Invited participants include specialists on narrative theory and life writing, prosopography or comparative studies of life narratives in groups, and the diverse field of digital humanities or computer-assisted research on cultural materials, from ancient texts to Colonial archives, from printed books to social media.
Invited participants include: Elton Barker, Jason Boyd, James Phelan, Susan Brown, Margaret Cormack, Courtney Evans, Will Hanley, Ben Jasnow, Ruth Page, Sue Perdue, Sidonie Smith. We hope to have lots of locals involved with digital work participate as well, and we particularly encourage graduate students to join in for the weekend!
Our symposium will bridge the gaps among our fields; share the innovations of several digital projects; and welcome the skeptical or the uninitiated, whether in our historical fields or in the applications of technology in the humanities. Booth, Clay, and Ogden have each led digital projects with some common themes and aims: locating, identifying, and interpreting the narratives—or very often, the lack of discursive records—about individuals in groups or documents, in Homer or other ancient text, Medieval French hagiography, and nineteenth-century printed collections of biographies in English. We want to open discussion of many potential methods including our own—data mining and digital editions of texts; relational databases and historical timelines and maps—for research on groups of interlinked persons, narratives or data about their lives, and documents or other records, and synthesizing and visualizing this research in accessible ways that reach students and the public. Digital innovation, however, should be informed by traditions of scholarly interpretation and advanced theoretical insights and commitments. Narrative theory and Theory generally, ideological critique including studies of gender and race, textual and book history studies, transnational and social historiography, philology and language studies, archeology, cultural geography and critical cartography, are all gaining influence on digital projects.
Invited participants will be posting about their research to our blog in the weeks leading up to the symposium, anyone is free to comment on the posts. In addition, our participants will be building a Zotero-powered bibliography in the weeks leading up to the symposium full of rich materials related to the event’s discussion.
Organized and hosted by Alison Booth, Jenny Strauss Clay, and Amy Odgen and sponsored by the Page Barbour Committee, the departments of English, French, and Art, the Institute for Humanities and Global Cultures, the Scholars’ Lab and Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, and other entities at UVa, all events are free and open to the public. More information can be found on the blog as planning progresses, and you can follow us on twitter at @livesdh.
Join in the conversation on the blog at movingpeoplelinkinglives.org, and we hope to see many come out for fruitful interchange in March!

I have been touting the use of Prism in the university classroom for some time now, but a recent exchange with Annie Swafford suggested to me that it might be worth explicitly outlining how I would go about doing so. With that in mind, I’ve composed the following set of questions for how I might frame discussion of Prism in the classroom. I’ve admittedly only had very brief chances to implement the tool in the classroom myself, so the thoughts come largely out of speculation and conversation. It should be noted as well that I assume below that you have already chosen a text and categories along which it should be marked (I may write on ways to approach such choices at a later date). In what follows, I move from general questions that I think would be helpful in framing any discussion of the tool to a particular use-case in James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The former questions inform and engage my latter use-case.
I prepare for class discussion by assembling a list of questions to be explored, and I would organize a Prism discussion around two lines of inquiry: tool-specific and visualization-specific. Some of these questions can be helpful for framing your own thoughts. Others could usefully be posed to the class as a whole as a means of framing discussion.
Tool-Specific Questions
How do the tool and our framing of it affect how we read the text? How is Prism’s mode of reading different from what we normally do? Is it the same that we’ve always been doing – close reading in a different form? What are the problems with the form? Can we really boil interpretation down to a series of numbers, visualize it, and move forward? Or is there more to interpretation than that? How do individual interpretations join in with the group reading? How much is the interpretive process encapsulated in the marking of a text? The visualization? The conversation that follows? How do the terms you choose for highlighting (the facets) guide the experience of reading the text? How do the explanations you provide for those terms affect the marking experience? When do the terms break down? If the terms propose a binary, what happens to that opposition over the course of the experience?
Visualization-Specific Questions
Which passages were marked the least for a particular category? The most? Why in either case? Which passages were particularly contentious, marked in many different ways? Where do particular categories cluster? How does the visualization show a relationship between the categories? How does your own interpretation link up to the collected visualization produced by the tool? Do the two visualizations tell us anything meaningful? Would we be able to find these meanings on our own? How does the visualization reflect the interpretive process? Why might we care more about a particular visualization for a particular reading? How is the quantified version of interpretation that Prism generates distinct from what we might learn from a discussion on our own? Can we imagine limits to this approach?
The primary job of an instructor using Prism is to help the students connect the results of the tool to the larger discussions encapsulated by the marking categories. Look at the results with a skeptical eye and ask how they can be meaningfully related to the ideas and provocations of the marking categories. My favorite early use of Prism asked users to mark James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man along the categories of “modernism” and “realism.” In a class, I would intersperse observations based on the visualizations with a discussion of the passage and the two marking categories. What do we mean by modernism? By realism? How is each expressed at the level of the text? What do we mean by literary experiment? By fragment? By realist details? What different genres does the text move through? Does the text construct a coherent narrative?
Putting realism and modernism alongside one another in Prism forces students to reconsider the binary, which quickly breaks down in practice. We can talk about whole novels or poems as belonging to one or another category, but can we do the same for individual sentences? For words? 80% of users at the time of this writing believe that the first word of the excerpt, “once,” is modernist. But why? If you look at the winning facet visualization, people seem primarily to be marking whole passages as one category – they are interpreting realism and modernism in chunks, not in terms of individual words. Readers tend to mark as modernist those generic changes where the excerpt suddenly adopts the form of nursery rhyme or of a fairy tale, suggesting that it is not any one genre but the shift between several in rapid succession that readers find to be modernist. The font size visualization suggests that those passages referencing physical actions by people are more likely to be associated with realist: “His father told him that story” and “When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold” are marked as being especially realist. With this observation in hand, why these details? Why are the body and the bodily detail markers of a realism? Why might an association with the family suggest realism? How do they come under pressure in the face of aesthetic experiment?
Obviously these suggestions are just beginnings for how to approach Prism in the classroom. Many other fascinating examples have already surfaced, particularly those that use the tool to teach basic reading and foreign language skills. Get in touch if you have used the tool in your classroom! I would love to hear how you did so.

This past year the Scholars’ Lab has implemented many performance upgrades and bug fixes for Prism. The most recent upgrade is particularly exciting: users can now deploy their own personal Prism installations to Heroku with the click of a button. Well - it will take the click of a button and a few other commands. I’ve added a section detailing just how to do so under the “Deploy to Heroku” section of the Prism Github’s readme.
It was already possible to implement private user communities by marking uploaded prism games as “unlisted” and then distributing the links to your group of participants. The Heroku deploy function makes this process a bit easier by allowing to users to host all of their games in one place. The process also sets you up well to tinker with the Prism codebase using a live app, as Heroku provides instructions for cloning the app to your desktop.
All of this on the heels of another exciting announcement: the Praxis Program has a short article on Prism appearing in the Digital Humanities 2013 special conference issue of Literary and Linguistic Computing. In the piece, we summarize Prism’s and interventions into conversations on crowdsourcing with special reference to its user interface.
It’s a good day to e-highlight!

Last week Sarah and I drove to Washington and Lee University as part of a new collaboration enabled by a grant from the Associated Colleges of the South. As part of the endeavor, Scholars’ Lab fellows are guest teaching pieces of an Introduction to Digital Humanities course. Our task, in particular, was to co-teach for a day on the topics of project management and software development. While we each took part and taught in both conversations, Sarah took the lead on the former topic and I took the latter.
I can’t rave enough about the experience enough, so I’ve organized my thoughts into three sections below.
Undergraduates + Digital Humanities = Dynamite
I am endlessly delighted by the reactions of undergraduates when they get introduced to the digital humanities. In virtually every case, I have encountered students hungry to learn the material. The W&L students were no exceptions. We found students ready to learn, eager to participate, and wiling to ask hard questions about the affordances and limitations of the field. You can find reflections by the students on their course blog. What’s more, the Washington and Lee students stand poised to make real contributions to digital scholarship. They have worked up some really interesting projects on the history of coeducation at W&L and on the changing vision and reality for Robert E. Lee’s Chapel on the university grounds.
Co-Teaching
Sarah and I work well together, and we have presented together in the past. But we had not taught together before the Washington and Lee trip. Full disclosure: I adore everything about co-teaching. It immediately disrupts the one-way transmission of information from the instructors to the students and forces the conversation to be more collaborative; co-teaching allows you to occupy simultaneously and more obviously the dual roles of student and teacher. It takes the pressure off any one person to keep the ship sailing smoothly, which empowers and enlivens the conversation. Co-teaching seems especially well-suited to the digital humanities, which value collaboration and play. Seminar discussions and workshops are different from working on teams to build projects, but co-instructors can make the experience a bit more lab-like, a bit more collaborative.
Teaching DH!
It is one thing to learn and practice digital humanities. It is another thing entirely to turn around and help others do the same. I have only really been hacking away for two years now, so I felt a bit unqualified to talk down software development as an invited speaker. I tend to assume that the Scholars’ Lab has a better sense of my own abilities than I do in most cases, though, and the invitation to W&L was no exception. The practice of putting together presentations on project management and software development was incredibly empowering. It helped me to have more confidence in myself as a digital humanist. No longer does the prospect of teaching an introduction to digital humanities course appear to be a vague and nebulous question mark. I now know that I could do it, because I have already done so in part. I also have a better sense of my own developing pedagogy of digital humanities. Opportunities to teach digital humanities like this, to perform with no net, are rare.
You teach to learn, and this is as true in the digital humanities as it is anywhere else. I learned a great deal from the bright undergraduates at W&L.

The following was co-authored and co-hacked with Claire.
Claire and I went to the Arduino Hackday hosted by the Scholars’ Lab on Friday. We had no idea what we were getting into, which made it all the more fun. Jeremy brought in a bunch of Arduino kits of all shapes and sizes, and various people went to work to see what they could make out of them.
First Claire and I got a blinking light to work. From there we decided to skip several chapters to make a little music player using a piezo speaker component. At that point we went off the map, dreaming big and working off the page. We started out working with this schematic, but we wanted to expand things a little.
I apologize in advance for whatever vocabulary gap there might be in the discussion below; it was my first time coding in C.
For one, this set-up only uses a single octave major scale. We opened things up by expanding the range of tones the speaker could play, including both a chromatic scale and adding an extra octave. One difficulty here was in the way that way that accidentals would be read by the board. At first we tried to use standard notation – f sharp would be represented by f#. But the code finds the notes in the melody by reading character by character through an array. So when the computer sees “cc#”, it processes it as two ‘c’s and one nonsense syllable that it can’t process. There is probably a more elegant solution, but we got around this by associating the accidentals with new characters entirely
C#/Db             =>       l

D#/Eb              =>       m

F#/Gb              =>       n

G#/Ab             =>       o

A#/Bb             =>       p

Next, we added an extra octave. To extend the range, we hard coded frequencies for the new notes according to the formula given by the original Arduino code:
timeHigh = period / 2 = 1 / (2 * toneFrequency)
We probably could have done this in a more dynamic way. Or, as Eric and Ronda showed, we could have just downloaded a tone library to do this for us. They were jamming out to the Star Wars theme while we were still trying to get things working.  But eventually, we were able to program in the opening of “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” Mozart’s Lacrimosa, John Coltrane’s “26-2,” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”
Here is where things got really ambitious, we came up with the idea to incorporate a RGB LED light that would change colors each time there was a note change in “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Rainbow lights for a song about rainbows.
To get the light working we worked off a slightly modified version of this schematic, mashed in with the piezo tutiorial. With some quick help from Eric, we modified the light arrangement so that each generates a random RGB combination. We then synchronized this with the rhythm of the melody.
In terms of the actual circuitry, we just split the digital signal so that it went out to two different parts of the bread board simultaneously and then fed information to both pins. Later we added a volume knob to reduce the maddening noise. You can see attached photos below, though you’ll have to meet us halfway with our diagram of the breadboard.
A later, unsuccessful attempt to key each frequency to a particular color resulted in a light that got brighter or darker depending on the note. I think with a little more time I could fix that by hard coding particular RGB values to particular frequencies, but we were trying to do it dynamically by converting the frequency directly into an intensity value.
Behold our final product!

The biggest issue that I have faced with my work with the Praxis Program has to do with how I judge the difficulty of the tasks before me. I have proven to be singularly inadequate at distinguishing quick fixes with a large payoff from larger problems that would yield only small utility. This issue surfaced early on, when I boldly suggested that I could implement Omniauth in a week. Two and a half months later I am still trying to get it to work: the Omniauth code structure works more generally, but each authentication service is its own unique little snowflake, different from all the other snowflakes in the code breaking eccentricities that it brings to the table. We had to jettison Twitter early on because it would not return user emails, which are central to the way that Devise handles logins. Facebook worked on local rails servers, but something whacky is happening on staging (and in deployment, for that matter) so that it throws a redirect uri failure at us that did not appear before. I feel as though I could have pounded away at these problems for ages and gotten nowhere.
But for every task like Omniauth there have been other jobs that seemed large but turned out to be much easier than expected. I implemented a destroy function on prisms last week in just a couple of hours (Shane had already provided a lot of the scaffolding on an older database setup), which meant that I also had to implement user roles and permissions using cancan. Cancan felt like a bigger job than it wound up being, and the whole thing seems to be working in the feature branch now. Now a user can delete a prism that they have uploaded. Great success!
I think this ability to distinguish between large and small tasks is something that can only come with time and experience. We Praxers may be unable to tell how much work a particular feature will require, but the SLab team has been incredibly helpful in that regard. Where we see mountains, they see molehills, and vice versa. And when you get right down to it, Prism seemed like the biggest mountain of all a couple months ago. Prism felt like an insurmountable task until last week when everything came together in a flurry of productivity. I am impressed with what we have done.
Now, without warning, a couple of inspirational climbing videos.

In writing the following post, I was struck by how close it felt to one Alex Gil wrote last year about a similar Prism disaster that he called the herokulypse. Alex wrote his post on April 23 of last year, so we’re a few days ahead of schedule for apocalyptic project events.
–
Over the past few weeks the Praxers have been diligently working on their own pieces of Prism. Gwen and Cecilia have been making strides with design, Chris has worked on highlighting and now visualizing, Shane has been doggedly attacking user uploads, and I worked on pieces of Omniauth, design, and uploads. On Monday we made our first attempt to really put things back together, and the result was pretty horrific.
My sense was that we had all broken Prism a little bit in our own special way. Some of these broken pieces weren’t really noticeable until we combined everything back together, when suddenly Prism became a big goopy mess. CSS was screwed up, the databases didn’t work right, migrations were failing, and the basic functionality of the highlight tool erupted as whole pages somehow morphed into copies of other pages. The crisis was mitigated thanks to the swift responses of Wayne and Jeremy, and things seem to be working again.
A lot of this could have been mitigated, I think, if we had better coordinated our feature branches. Instead, a lot of us were working on a big feature branch: “user uploads” or “omniauth.” It would have been better to break those out into smaller pieces so that any damage from merging would be manageable and less the nightmarish event that ensued. An “omniauth” branch could become multiple branches, one each for Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.
Admittedly, some of the work that we have been doing has been of the sort that I don’t think you can really divide up easily. Shane and I have been working on refactoring the databases, and large scale changes like that seem like they should happen all at once. Even so, I think we could have found ways to organize our work better. This would have, of course, necessitated better planning on our part ahead of time.
Surprise: the SLab gurus have been telling us all along to make more and smaller feature branches.
Listen to your digital elders. They know all the things.

After several weeks of grinding away with the generous help of Eric and Shane, Omniauth works with our current setup. Now a user can arrive at our site and log into the system using their Facebook or Google accounts as an alternative to creating their own Prism-specific login.
One significant difficulty we encountered was how to handle multiple authentications. In the default framework, the system creates a new user when you authenticate through a service. So, if a user clicks on Facebook authentication, that action creates a new user in the database. If that same user comes back and clicks Twitter instead, that user will then have a separate account unlinked to the first in the database. Rather than implement an authentication management system, we decided to add a disclaimer to the myPrisms page directing users to login with the correct accounts if they aren’t seeing the information that they expect.
Another difficulty: initially we also wanted to include Twitter authentication, but Twitter returns only the user’s nickname instead of an email. This is a problem for Devise, the gem that we use to handle the logins more generally. Devise has emails pretty firmly integrated into their framework, and things got quite whacky when we tried to disable email as the verifying function for new users. We successfully did so, but each new success raised new problems related to the nickname/email interactions. At length, we decided just to go with Facebook and Google for now. Any future authentications that we implement will be chosen based on whether or not they return user emails.
Next, I’ll be helping Shane move forward with allowing User Uploads.

As we gear up for Prism development proper, I have been trying to get up to speed with some coding basics so that I can hit the ground running. Here are the learning aids that I have found most useful over the past couple weeks. Nearly all of these materials can be found in the Praxis Program’s scratchpad.
Ruby
Learn Ruby the Hard Way - I enjoyed the learning approach here: the site displays a chunk of code that you type out, fix, and then examine more closely. It might seem like working backwards, but it works well for people who learn by doing.
Ruby Warrior - Learn Ruby by programming your own video game! There is nothing quite like tricking your brain to work. Each new level presents a problem that you must solve by changing a Ruby file. This one is great for learning the syntax, but it will only go so far in teaching the methods available to you in Ruby. You’ll be doing a lot of methods unique to the game, and I doubt that warrior.walk!(:backward) will come up in normal situations. Syntax is all, though.
Rails
Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial - Hartl walks you through building an application step by step via a Rails scaffolding. They are quite thorough and easy to follow.
RailsCasts - These very short video tutorials walk you through Ruby on Rails concepts with screencasts and commentary.
JavaScript
Code Academy - I’ve been using Code Academy for JavaScript, but they also have HTML, Ruby, Python, and several other coding tracks. There are a wealth of resources here arranged in interactive exercises, and the site also has lots of extra opportunities for practice once you finish the main courses. It also gives out points and badges as you code for added incentive!

As we move into the second half of our tenure on the Praxis squad, we are feeling the pressure to start actually making something. To that end, the SLab crew asked us to make a list of our priorities for Prism. Hopefully this will help us make a to do list in the coming weeks. The following was the list that seemed to come out of yesterday’s meeting, though it’s possible that other people could have gotten different impressions from the conversation.
These seem to be our priorities, in no particular order except roughly that in which they were brought up:
Types of texts - we’re interested in opening up the Prism framework to deal with pictures, music, etc.
Getting a crowd - we want to get a large group of people working with Prism, however that might be arranged.
Visualizations - we’re interested in expanding Prism’s visualizations to allow you to see the individual set of markings in relation to the crowd and to let you see one marking category’s visualization beside another.
User uploads - we want to make it possible for users/instructors to upload a text for marking themselves, which we see as essential for classroom use.
Complicating the sense of how we highlight - there has been discussion of complicating how the marking system works, allowing for a limit to the number of markings or a type of marking economy that is distributed across your selections to encourage different types of engagement with the data.
Design makeover - we want to remake the design of the site with an eye to usability.
I think my own priorities lie in making it possible for users to upload their own texts for marking and in possibly adding more visualizations. If forced to choose between the two, I would spend the time on making the tool capable of handling user uploads. As quickly became clear, any one of these goals spins off into dozens of other questions. What do we mean by “upload a text”? Will those texts be public? Private? How will we navigate copyright and fair use? In the coming days we’re aiming to get a sense of our collective ordering of the list.

I just recently posted my experiment with making a Ruby program that you can use for doing your own grading. I have since made several improvements upon the first draft of the code, so I present to you Ruby Grading 2.0.
The changes:
1) I converted the code to incorporate classes, which was a huge learning process for me that involved lots of troubleshooting. I think I am starting to get the hang of classes and understand their importance. The conversion process was nightmarish, but they allow you to be a lot more flexible when trying to include new tasks. Plus, I learned a lot from the ordeal.
2) I made it so that you can now input your entire roster into the grading program and calculate all your final grades there. You only input the syllabus parameters once, at the beginning. The program saves these and then applies them to all the students on your list. At the end it will spit out a nice little list of students’ names and their final percentage grades.
3) I also tweaked several small things as I went to account for differing input situations. Before the program couldn’t account for certain types of input. For example, if you typed in “three” and not “3” when prompted for the number of assignments, the program would break. I still am not quite sure how best to deal with those sorts of situations; I couldn’t really find a satisfactory test for whether or not input was convertible to an integer or not, so I think I invented one that seems to work (see lines 136-141 of the code). My test:

I cast the input string to an integer. If the integer is greater than one the code works. If not, something has gone wrong (who assigns fewer than one assignments), and it will ask for the input as an integer. It works, but it feels like a particularly dirty way of doing things. Next up, three things if I should continue: 1) Make it so that quizzes can be dynamically inputted into the program interface, with the possibility to drop the lowest one if necessary. 2) Consider making a version of the program that reads out of other files so that you don’t have to do all your grading in one session. After all, we keep our gradebooks as we go, so this information is all typed somewhere else. It seems like the biggest time save would be to have it open a file, examine its contents, and spit out a calculated final grade for you. 3) Maybe include a method that will convert the percentages to letter grades.

Chris recently posted his very exciting experiment that uses Ruby to create music theory worksheets for his students. Inspired by this, I have been playing around on Ruby with much more modest aims: I wanted to use Ruby to do my grading for me. I always do my grading with an Excel spreadsheet and a series of formulas. I am not particularly skilled at that interface, though, and it usually takes me a while to get it to work right. I thought I might as well try to do the same thing in Ruby. Admittedly, this idea also came from Chris: he has been claiming that such a thing was a very real possibility for weeks now.
Here is the source code. It’s a fairly rudimentary interface at this point, but it does seem to work. It allows you to compute a student’s final grade in a course where assignment types are weighted differently.
I hope to keep tinkering with this over time. Some things that I would want to include in later versions:
1) Clean up the code. I don’t feel very comfortable with classes at the moment, so I bend over backwards to accommodate that lack. I think the first step to making this more dynamic and workable will be to class it up. Right now the code only runs straight down, start to finish. Organizing the code in a more dynamic way will allow the program to be more workable to a variety of circumstances, which leads into my second point.
2) Make the interface more flexible for a variety of types of course arrangements. Right now, it’s really only set up to work for a certain type of class with a few types of assignments. I have it set up so that you input the number of different types of assignments you have, ex: paper one, paper two, midterm, and final. But there isn’t really a way to account for multiple smaller assignments that make up a larger chunk of grading, like individual quizzes as part of a larger whole. Right now you would have to average the quiz grades ahead of time and then enter the composite grade in as one lump “quizzes” category. That also means that, if you want to drop the lowest quiz grade, you have to do that on your own. Also, the program completes its run after completing the grade for one student.
My priority right now was making it work for my purposes - a class with less than twenty students and a limited number of assignments. It seems to work for that. Take a shot at breaking it.

Since Gwen just posted her solution to the Fizz Buzz homework assignment,  I thought that I would throw mine up here as well. Here is my solution.
It’s pretty similar to Gwen’s take on the problem. I just switched the order of a couple things and used a couple shortcuts. I also apparently have a penchant for extra parentheses to help organize things.
I do feel like I perhaps missed the point of the exercise, given that it was tacked onto Wayne’s discussion of object-oriented programming and classes. Perhaps we were meant to solve this problem using that approach? In any case, there is no one way to make breakfast; I’ll take my approach for now, until I have a better grasp of object-oriented programming. I’ll use what I know.

I just recently hopped on Twitter for the first time as part of a conference through UVA’s Institute for the Humanities and Global Cultures. It was a bit rough for the first five or six tweets as I worked out the kinks. Here are some thoughts that came out of the experience.
I am hooked on tweeting conference presentations. I was a bit worried that tweeting would be too distracting during a talk, but I actually found that it made me a better listener. I was forced to listen hard to find discernible takeaways, which helped me to digest the information being thrown at me. Also, it gave me a way to occupy my wandering attention in a productive way. Tweeting also seems like a good way to extend the life of the conference after the proceedings are complete.
On that same note, the SLab crew has had a few conversations about how Twitter interacts with intellectual property. I felt obligated to assign many tweets I made to a particular person, assuming that I was giving credit where it was due. If our labor is intellectual, I wanted to do my best to make sure that I didn’t obscure the architect of a particular idea. I wonder, though, if conference attendees would rather not be held permanently accountable for comments they make during a question and answer session. Is Twitter in this form a form of publishing? Do you need someone’s permission to post their thoughts in the Twitterverse?
I also find Twitter interesting for the amount of access it gives you to people and groups that you might not otherwise be able reach. Tweeting can put you in touch with so many people that would be otherwise inaccessible. It’s really quite incredible - I’ve heard several stories now of people who got jobs or made industry contacts that were completely unexpected simply by shooting some messages out into the ether. I don’t have an personal experience like this just yet, but I will keep you posted.
A question: what is tweeting etiquette - more generally but also in the context of tweeting conference presentations? How many tweets are appropriate? I was averaging five or six tweets per talk, but I noticed that other people tweeting the conference were doing far fewer. I could not help but feel that my loyal followers (all four of you) were being bombarded by my messages about global cultures.
It remains to be seen how much I will tweet in my everyday life, but I think I will use it for conferences from now on. Follow me - @walshbr

It’s been a tad quiet on the blog front over the past couple weeks. Here is what the Praxis squad has been up to.
It’s been a great week for collaborative writing. We put together a poster abstract for DH 2013 that crystallized a lot of our thoughts on Prism and crowdsourcing thus far. Perhaps we will see some of our loyal readers there? The poster abstract that we put together discusses crowdsourcing as a continuum from more mechanical interaction to forms that maintain more of a sense of the autonomous individual. We concluded by conceiving of a few different types of interfaces for Prism and the ways in which they might affect the nature of the crowdsourcing process. Much of the abstract was put together with multiple people writing different parts of the document at the same time, which I thought was an interesting enactment of the sorts of questions and issues that we have been working through. It was great to see each person’s piece combined into the whole. Special shout-out to Gwen for taking the lead on the abstract coordination/writing and to Jeremy for his expert wisdom.
Part of the reason for radio silence has been a distinct shift in our day to day work. After finishing the poster abstract, Wayne and company started hitting us hard and fast with code boot camp. So far we’ve dipped into command line, git, and ruby on rails. Things are going pretty well so far - it feels a little like taking a giant cyber-multivitamin as we prepare to put all of our plans for Prism into action in the next few months. When asked to explain git and version control, I like to do so by comparing it to time travel without the risk of creating a universe collapsing paradox. For next week we are moving through the first ten exercises of Learn Ruby the Hard Way. The idea is that you type out letter for letter a series of code, trouble shoot if it doesn’t run, and then reflect back on what you wrote. This seems a bit unusual - I would expect a more traditional format to teach you the concept first and then enact the code yourself. The LRTHW model works great for my personality type: I always have a hard time with training of any sort. Invariably in any new employee training, my attention immediately starts to wander as soon as my superior starts to explain something to me, and I always wind up learning by doing. So this reversed pedagogical model works well for me: I do first and then think back on the process. I can imagine it being very frustrating, though, if you are the kind of student that dutifully pays attention to the lesson on view.
It’s an interesting model, and I wonder if it could be adapted for the humanities. What might that entail? Maybe I could have my students type out an essay paragraph word for word and then reflect on it after the fact. Would the model still work, or is there something about humanities thinking that requires that the thinking/learning precede the doing?

Jeremy asked us to offer a Prism exercise that would take the tool in a new direction. Rather than expanding the tool’s parameters, I would like to think about how we can get a more nuanced understanding of the information it already collects. In what follows I offer a vaporware exercise that we will play in person, suggest some thoughts on the disciplinary and pedagogical questions it might answer, and I conclude with some suggestions for adapting the exercise for digital use.
The idea: rather than marking multiple categories, all participants mark a single category. Each person has his or her own unique marking color.
The text: The specific text is not important for this particular idea, but for the sake of the exercise I will use “The Weary Blues” by Langston Hughes
The marking: Other(s)
The research/pedagogical issues at stake: The exercise was designed with pedagogy in mind. In the final visualization, the color constellation tells us who marked what in a clearer way: red for Brandon, green for Cecilia, etc. This is absolutely vital if we are going to use the tool for pedagogical purposes. Rather than submerging the voices into a bundle of data with no way back, this approach allows us to see the overlap and disjunctures between different interpretations more clearly. In the vaporware version, we can’t really do this without pulling the transparencies apart again to see them individually, which destroys the collective image. By restoring clarity to the individual voice, we can more easily open up a conversation with students. What did a particular student mark? Why? How does this relate to the aggregate? How does a particular voice interact with the crowd? These discussions of individual vs crowd work particularly well for this textual example: the poem obsesses over the relation between speaker and musician, poetry and tradition, individual and community, etc. Just as scholars would discuss how the lines blur between individuals and groups of people in the poem, the marking activity can open a meta-discussion about the nature of our own marking activity as an intellectual endeavor – a collaborative one nonetheless comprised of individual gestures.
There is also a fairly selfish short-term application to this: it simplifies things. As Gwen mentioned, throwing together eight transparencies all marked for three different things comes across as a big glob of data. Maybe the above approach can declutter things for our short-term training as Prism initiates. In this vaporware experiment, a mark means one thing only—the color tells you who did it. One category might not mean fewer markings, but it would at least be easier for us to process with fewer different systems of meaning on the overhead. I imagine that this (hopefully) simplified exercise is something that we need to just get a sense of what sorts of conversations, interpretations, and gains can come out of Prism at all. In a similar manner, the current Prism visualization only deals with one marking at a time. You sort by marker, and you don’t see all the markings at once.
The above approach is designed for the vaporware transparency game, so it obviously only works with small groups of people. This makes me wonder if it is even a viable option for working with a “crowd.” It seems very useful for pedagogy, but would such a thing even be feasible with a class of 20 students? I don’t think so. You’d have to get a really big packet of markers and a very nuanced sense of the color pallet. So this is really an idea that needs the technology in order to function. Here is a variation on the idea behind this exercise that would work for the online tool.
Users mark as usual and go to visualize. Below or next to the list of markers, we have a dropdown menu with a list of the users. Mousing over a particular username causes their markings to appear in the text, allowing you to compare their markings with the crowd’s aggregate. How these individual markers are visualized in relation to the mass is up for debate. One idea to implement this would be to underline each word that the user marks: a really big word not underlined means that the user did not mark it, but a large portion of the crowd did. A small word underlined means that the user marked it, but the crowd did not. This is not a perfect system, so I’m open to ideas. And this doesn’t even begin to broach the question of how the sorts of conversations I imagine coming out of Prism can possibly emerge when users are not all in a single room together. But I do think this larger question of retaining the individual user’s gesture and their markings is an important one – a step towards retaining their voice and even their humanity, in just the sense that Claire references.

This week, the team has been throwing around a number of ideas as to how we can further develop Prism. I keep falling back on spatial metaphors to categorize the changes currently in play. I threw the following model onto the SLab white board, wherein I propose two types of changes: vertical and horizontal.

First, the vertical axis, those changes which work within the tool’s existing functionality. Some changes deepen a function already in place. The suggestions offered by last year’s team for other visualizations would fall into this category. A new visualization can offer a more dynamic interaction with a set of markings, but users are still engaging with the same dataset. The fundamental function of the tool would remain the same. These sorts of vertical changes offer a deeper, more robust mode of interaction with the operations that the tool can already carry out.
I oppose these to horizontal changes, which more fundamentally alter the number and types of things that a tool can do. We have talked a lot about carrying Prism into other media: music, images, and video. We have also talked about freeing up the controls on Prism, making it possible for users to upload their own texts or to hide the categories prior to marking. These sorts of modifications change the face of Prism more drastically, resulting in different data sets and new possibilities for the users.
These horizontal changes seem to carry the highest risk. As we discussed at our meeting last week, we risk diluting Prism’s identity if we try to add in too many features: a tool that can do anything might just be a tool that can do nothing effectively. The SLab crew also pointed out how some of our broadening changes might carry us into territory that has already been covered by other developers and other tools. At the same time, though, some of suggestions for horizontal growth are incredibly exciting. Taking Prism into other media, freeing up the controls – these changes could help Prism reach a broader audience by teaching it new tricks. I think we should take them seriously.
Of course, this horizontal/vertical distinction does not quite hold up under close scrutiny. I think it would be a mistake to think of depth-oriented changes as being somehow narrower than broader changes. A new visualization could fundamentally alter your relation to the data in such a way that it feels as though the functionality has altered entirely. No modification slots entirely into one or the other category, and the spatial metaphors might muddy the waters unnecessarily. All the same, I find the distinction helpful for mapping out the morphing shape of the Prism of the future.
So do we build depth, or do we broaden our base? Do we dig into the features already present, or do we add new ones? At what point does Prism cease to be Prism? What would Prism look like if we graphed it?

My first experience with Prism last spring brought something of an existential crisis along with it, when I was asked to mark my beloved A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in terms of realism/modernism:

He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
O, the wild rose blossoms
On the little green place.

Considering Portrait as a modernist novel was nothing new, but being asked to consider individual words in that context was altogether unsettling. Words like “tuckoo” and “moocow” are easy to mark as modernist, but “baby” is perfectly reasonable within a realist text; it only begins to feel experimental as a part of the larger phrase “baby tuckoo.” And how do we account for the two lines of verse, where the words themselves are not particularly experimental but the juxtaposition between prose and poetry creates just the sort of genre bending you would expect from modernism?
I think this very brief analysis tells us something very important about how we make meaning: interpretive choices depend not just on the words in the text but on perceived relationships among different textual groupings within the text as a whole. Part of the perceived value of a crowdsourcing tool like Prism comes from its ability to generate conversations about these interpretive decisions. I wonder, though, if we can include these conservations in the tool itself.
The obvious response to this perceived need would be to prompt users to justify each interpretive decision they make, but this seems undesirable. I expect that the interface would become unwieldy very quickly if we asked users to explain every marking that they make, and I imagine that the defensive posture this would engender in users could be inimical to the nature of the tool’s ethos.
Perhaps we could consider an opt-in approach, where we offer users the option to select a particular marking and offer a short explanation after marking and just before saving the highlights. Then these terms could be footnoted in some way for visualization. Perhaps we could even run some sort of thesaurus program to link similar explanations across different marked passages.
I don’t mean to imply that this is a flaw in the Prism’s design: I think one of the more mind expanding aspects of the tool is how it lays bare the process by which word transforms into meaning. I hope we can find a way to front-end this strength in the user interface.

In middle school I built a website about the seven wonders of the ancient world. Nothing fancy – just images and some links – and I never published it. Building a personal website over the past few days as per Jeremy’s request feels a bit like coming full circle. My HTML skills remain prepubescent at best, and my barebones site keeps the spirit of GeoCities in the early 1990’s alive and well. Check it out. http://walshbr.com/old-site/.
I admit to some hesitation in posting this fledgling site for all to see: so much more could be done to bring it into the twenty-first century. But I keep coming back to Bethany’s encouragement last week to fail in public, advice with which I am in love. My graduate training thus far has emphasized polish and perfection, for clear and obvious reasons. But even at this early stage, my work with Praxis feels more electric knowing that mistakes are welcome and that failure is viewed as a space of experimentation and elaboration rather than embarrassment.
I cannot imagine any sort of collaborative activity (teaching included) that would not benefit from a healthy injection of interpersonal risk. We can’t really work together until we know each other, and that depth of knowledge only comes from admitting that we don’t have all the answers and that we don’t always succeed. Opening yourself up to such failures and recognizing their importance as part of any process is a necessary step towards collaboration that is more honest and certainly more human.
A promise for you out there in the ether: by the end of the year I will have turned failing into an art form. I’m sure in May I will look back on this early site with disdain and an eye to incorporating all sorts of tech wizardry. Maybe I’ll add a GIF. For now, I’m off to break the Internet.

For some time now I have led a double life as a musician and book lover. As a third year PhD in the English department at UVA, I work primarily on twentieth-century fiction in relation to music and sound. These interests drew me to Praxis in the first place: writing about sound is incredibly difficult in a print medium where the reader can’t hear what I describe. I am very excited to be a part of the Praxis team this year, where as a DH novitiate I hope to learn how technology can help make those two fields work together more easily. The Scholars’ Lab team seems happy to have us as well, welcoming the new team with open arms and inscrutable computer science jokes. Last year’s Praxis team reached out to us many months ago from their charter:

Preparations for future cohorts 
In order to allow the next Praxis Program team to start work right away on a project, we will make suggestions for that project before our tenure is over.

How nice to be thought of! But I think this excerpt shows how our situation is fundamentally different from theirs: last year’s team had to deal only with the future, but our team also has to deal with the past. It would be easy for us to feel anxiety as latecomers to the Praxis party, so I think it’s important that our own charter reflect the ways in which our work will talk back to last year’s team.
As I look through last year’s blog posts, I’m struck by the problem of knowledge we have in store for us. Implicit in the suggestions offered to us are all the ideas that last year’s team discarded, thought better of, and revised. Those are what I really want to see! The archive of blog posts can only give a skeletal sense of the past: there is no replacement for sitting in that chair all last year.
So beyond the question of how we deal with their great suggestions, I am struck by a more basic dilemma: what sort of dialogue will we have with last year’s group? I imagine that the cheerful team in the Scholars Lab will welcome repeat conversations as opportunities to rethink and retool, but I also believe that we can benefit from the experience of those who came before. I hope that we can continue the conversation with both those members of last year’s team that are still on grounds and those that have moved on to wonderful jobs across the country.
Even so, it is also important for us to recognize that, try as we might, we can never know everything about the project’s history to date. Our team will work better in the long run if we welcome the unknown and greet it just as enthusiastically as it welcomes us.

What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. You can find book-related posts here. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email at bmw9t@virginia.edu.

Every institution has embedded pedagogies—tacit structures, policies, and norms that govern the possibilities for teaching and learning. The curriculum is only one place in which teaching happens in higher education: every interaction is also a form of teaching, whether it pertains to a syllabus, a budget, or the use of campus space. In other words, the classroom is inseparable from the infrastructure that supports its work. The teacher struggling to find resources for her students, for example, cannot help but have her work affected by the threat of budget cuts. As sociologist Jessica Calarco and others have argued, students are often subject to a hidden curriculum of expectations and practices that reinforce social inequalities. I build on this work by offering a theory of the embedded pedagogies of institutions, those interrelated sets of strictures that pressure instructors to adopt particular pedagogies regardless of their own personal inclination. The book argues that, while these embedded pedagogies could feasibly support effective teaching, they most often inhibit justice-oriented approaches to education. 
Educators are under threat, struggling with institutional instability, scarcity, and political attacks on their work. This book offers guidance for instructors struggling with how to teach effectively in such uncertain and hostile environments, whether that teaching takes place in the classroom or elsewhere. With digital humanities pedagogy at US-based institutions of higher education as a frame and focus, I argue for an approach to teaching and learning that seeks to build more just and equitable institutions while also offering strategies to endure the negative ways these structures influence our work. This book offers a theory and practice of DH pedagogy by speaking from the position of a practitioner tasked with both teaching and administrating in the context of a public university in crisis. Teaching administrators, as I call people in roles like mine, are uniquely positioned to lay bare the pedagogical implications of infrastructural decisions at the same time that they implement a classroom practice that intervenes in their local institution. However, since many of these positions are institutionally unique, term-limited, or one-off, this unique vantage point has not often been formally explored. By focusing specifically on this intersection of teaching and administration, this book offers as much in the way of day-to-day approaches to the DH classroom as it does a far-reaching vision for how our pedagogies can help to bring about a university that is more stable, more sustainable, and more just.
The institutional structures that impact teaching are especially salient for those instructors who work outside departmental silos. For staff who work across departments, the warp and weft of the institutional pedagogy is particularly noticeable because we so regularly come into contact with patrons from across the university. DH pedagogy serves as a useful object of study in this regard, as so much DH teaching takes place in the cracks of the university. As a librarian, I have taught credit-bearing courses as well as one-off workshops, consulted on a graduate certificate in digital humanities as well as mentored students individually. Teaching in these spaces, I argue, reveals the pedagogies operationalized by our institutions for and against our work as teachers. Furthermore, because of its intensely collaborative and cross-disciplinary work, digital humanities teaching frequently forces encounters—and friction—with the university in ways that more narrowly discipline-specific instruction might not. Any instructor is subject to policy. But the librarian providing instruction in digital technology is especially aware of its impact and the ways in which it can be hostile to learning. 
In meeting the limited knowability of the university, we meet the first of the five characteristics that will give this book its structure:

Knowable
Neutral
Intellectual
Prestigious
Forward-looking

These characteristics form the basis of the stories that institutions of higher education typically tell about themselves and who they want to be. They form the basis of the neoliberal university and its mode of describing itself. In each case, these values exert power over the kinds of teaching and learning possible in their spaces, often in ways that instructors would not willingly ascribe to. The body of the book centers on the narratives that universities use to frame themselves as bastions of neutrality, intellectualism, and prestige. In each chapter, I critique the ways in which these values impose themselves as pedagogical forces on DH teachers and offer a pair of action-oriented responses, first as an administrator thinking pedagogically and then as a teacher thinking administratively. The result is one part theory, one part lesson plan. One part discussion, one part assignment template. As educators faced with frustrating circumstances, it can be easy to feel disempowered, as though the institution is too large to change, and to turn inwards, narrowly focusing on the day’s lesson plan in order to carry on. I argue, instead, for a renewed view of higher education institutions in familiar terms for teachers. By demystifying and breaking them down as pedagogical systems, teachers can find opportunities for change and create the conditions for our learning communities to thrive.
The book concludes by meditating on the contested futures at the center of university life. Universities often claim to look towards the future while enshrining hyper-conservative institutional values that favor the past and refuse change. As such, I conclude by questioning the futures towards which universities are working. Who do these futures belong to? Our communities? Or a substratum of donors, politicians, and pundits? We cannot afford to treat the classroom as closed off, separate from the broader administrative context that shapes its spaces. By seeing teaching as an extension of policy—and policy, in turn, as a set of pedagogical interventions—educators can co-create a more hopeful future with their communities. Taken together, the book offers a roadmap for DH educators aiming to push their teaching and their institutions towards more just futures for teachers and learners. By rendering visible the pedagogical structures at the core of the university, I hope to empower educators to develop the tools to change them, in and out of the classroom.
For a first foray into the ways in which the teaching administrator may intervene in their own institution, we can meet the university’s limited knowability with a pedagogy of transparency. The first experiences many members of the university community have of their institutions are heavily manufactured. Whether through mailers to prospective students, new faculty orientations, or ongoing marketing and communication campaigns, universities have a vested interest in the careful articulation of themselves as particular kinds of institutions with specific values, processes, and audiences. Despite these broad campaigns to appear known in the public eye, I argue that this knowability is limited by design: universities deliberately obscure their workings from their community members, a fact that can hide the ways in which institutional policies and choices structure the possibilities for learning available to teachers and students. From an administrative standpoint, I first examine budgets as pedagogical technologies1 that can offer students a vehicle by which they can better understand the infrastructure of their university. Second, from a classroom perspective, I examine digital humanities student projects that challenge the narratives universities share with the public and that attempt to make known their difficult histories. By questioning the received knowability of our institutions in our teaching we can illuminate their effects on our work. By recognizing administrative decisions as pedagogical ones we can recast them on grounds in which teachers might intervene.



This section has already been published as “The Pedagogy of Digital Humanities Budgets” in Issue 25 of The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. But I might post a very short blog post that contextualizes that piece and gives thoughts on how it might need to change as part of the book project. ↩

We’ve got a new thing cooking in the lab - a bite-sized project from Rachel Retica, Seanna Viechweg, and myself. Here’s the description we’ve shared around for what we are calling the “Snack-Sized Digital Pedagogy” series.

It’s important to maintain a balanced teaching diet! This free and open-to-the-public zoom series on digital pedagogy features paired lightning talks introducing teaching topics, interesting approaches to the classroom, pedagogical concepts, and more. All in a bite-sized form that should still give you plenty to chew on. In the spirit of the #DHMakes Methodz talks, each session will be built around paired 5 minute presentations followed by facilitated discussion for the remainder of the time.
Interested in showing off a pedagogical bite? Please fill out this form to indicate your interest in participating in the future! The presentations can cover a wide variety of topics: a tool that is new to you, a teaching tip, pedagogical concept, assignment, your syllabus for a DH course, etc. We’re interested in showcasing anything you have found that moves you or your students in the classroom, that has worked well or failed utterly. And we are very interested in perspectives from folks in all different kinds of positions and institutional contexts—higher ed, K-12, administrators, cultural heritage workers, and more. After the session, each speaker will submit a short one-page (max) version of their five-minute presentation to Knowledge Commons. We’ll collect references to all the contributions into a crowdsourced, citable web publication of bite-sized DH pedagogical goodness.

We already had one session with two bite-sized talks from Megan Brett and Emily McGinn on different ways to approach teaching with data. Emily gave a breezy introduction to teaching computational thinking with an activity called “Asking Questions of Data: How to Think Like a Computer” and Megan shared a minimal exercise for helping students to construct data from primary documents called “Thinking About Historic Data.” I’m enjoying the talks and also pleased that we hit upon a workflow for giving the presentations afterlives: after the event folks are updating their presentations to Knowledge Commons and sharing back citations for us to collect in one place. Future-proofed, professionally legible pedagogy.
The next snack-sized digital pedagogy is titled “On Making” and will feature Jajwalya Karajgikar and Amanda Licastro on Friday, April 4th 2025 from 1:00-2:00PM EST. More information about their planned contributions:

Jajwalya Karajgikar, Applied Data Science Librarian, University of Pennsylvania Library
    
Blurb: When we consider library services and patrons in higher education, we typically think of resources, databases, and other mechanisms for the transfer of knowledge. More difficult to encapsulate is the sense of community building that occurs in the library as an impartial space for technology, information literacy, and campus well-being. This is the function of many research data, digital scholarship, and maker-space centers within the library. This short talk elaborates on collaborative projects that facilitate the development of deep relationships with people on campus through Slow Process Making and Embodied Critical Making.


Amanda Licastro, Head of Digital Scholarship Strategies and Visiting Associate Professor in English at Swarthmore College
    
Blurb: Interested in introducing your students to the world of #DHMakes? This presentation will review a series of scaffolded workshops aimed at making space for humanists in the Makerspace. With a focus on building critical collaborations across campus, audience members will gain practical tips on how to design hands-on, creative assignments with public-facing products. The culminating example will be an exhibit created by students in my undergraduate English course inspired by sci-fi literature, surveillance theory, and archival objects from Special Collections.



Register to join us for the second snack-sized event on zoom. And please get in touch using our form if you would like to share your own work at a future session. I’m excited to see where this series goes!
More snacks soon.

Job ads in higher education are confusing. This is especially true of digital humanities positions that can combine multiple positions—faculty, staff, student—into one. Students might have a particularly hard time decoding these job ads. I often find that the fellows I work with need some help learning to read and decipher these postings so they can feel confident seeking out and applying for their first DH job. The Association for Computers in the Humanities sometimes runs panels designed to discuss these skills. I thought I would share my own professional development activity that I often run with students to build this literacy.
You will need:

Three printed DH job ads
    
This can be tricky, as most job ads disappear once they are filled. You can still find some evidence of a posting here or there from organizations that crosspost them outside of the institutional HR site. H-net has a series of job listings, for example, and Code4Lib does not seem to take down their copies of old jobs. I think it works well to have different kinds of jobs in the mix - one faculty, one administrator, and one programer position, for example.


A space for conversation
    
If it’s just you and one other person you could go for coffee. Otherwise I could imagine this working in small groups.


60 minutes for the activity

From there, I have students spend roughly 10 minutes looking at a job and 10 minutes discussing it before repeating twice more for the other two positions. As they move through, I ask students what they notice about each job:

What seems consistent?
What is different about each position?
What is confusing?
What would make them confident applying to it?

As I go, I balance the students’ reflections with my own, and I try to guide the conversation around a specific set of topics that students are most likely to need help understanding: qualifications, responsibilities, the institutional history, and the ethics of the job. Below I share some of the things I try to point out in those conversations.
Qualifications
While qualifications often aren’t the first part of a job posting, they’re frequently the thing that students gravitate towards when seeing an ad for the first time. I think this comes from a position of anxiety. Students often are insecure in their own qualifications, and so they see a list of skills and methods and immediately feel like they don’t qualify. So some familiarity in how to understand lists of qualifications might be helpful. To begin, I often tell students to look for specific words like “and” or “or.” Does the job ask for Python, R, and JavaScript? Or does the job ask for just one of the three? Sometimes, this might even be worded as “the ability to solve technical problems with a programming language of your choice.” These distinctions might seem small, but they are often an indicator of whether or not a job is looking for a unicorn—a position that wants you to be expert in everything under the sun. In a list that asks for one or two skills out of a list you can often take them at their word. Pay attention to whether the job gives you opportunity to not know everything.
I often describe a DH job as consisting of many different kinds of buckets where each category corresponds to specific topics or methods. Some examples of these might include critical making, text analysis, 3D modeling, GIS, programming, database design, digital archives, or more. Together, in some combination, these buckets make up a job. A person. No one will actually have expertise in every single one of these things. But most professional DHers are familiar some arrangement of them and expert in a smaller subset. I often encourage students to think of themselves in these terms when starting out: identify one specific area of expertise and and then several more for familiarity.1 I encourage the students to see the big buckets. What are they familiar with? What do they have expertise in? Sometimes a job posting will list “preferred qualifications,” a handy way to directly map the job needs to your own hierarchy of familiarity and expertise. I encourage students not to be dismayed if the position in front of them does not match up to their own profile. Instead, think about how they can develop a plan to grow the timeframe that they have. They might not fit this job, but they can have the right buckets next time.
Responsibilities
The responsibilities for a position are often where you can find out what the job will actually be doing, so it can be helpful to read these in conversation with the listed skills and qualifications. Sometimes they will give you a sense of what skills are actually likely to be key and which are more icing on the cake. If the qualifications don’t seem to line up to the responsibilities that’s probably an indication that the job might be an untenable one, or that it might be pulled in too many directions. Approach these gigs with caution.
Digital Humanities positions can be a whole broad range of things. Sometimes the job titles aren’t very descriptive. You might see something like a DH specialist, a DH coordinator, a DH librarian, and those words don’t necessarily tell you a lot about the specific institutional needs for that position. The same job title can mean very different things at different places. The responsibilities are where you were more typically find more about what would actually be asked of you. Sometimes the descriptions of responsibilities are not especially helpful. They might list things like “responsible for collaborating with faculty,” “teaches a variety of workshops,” or other kinds of generic descriptors that might only give you a general indication of what the job is. Sometimes, you’ll be luckier. An ad might list the specific projects that you would be directly involved in overseeing and implementing, as in “responsible for the development and maintenance of a digital archive of XYZ.” Those are things to note and to speak to in a cover letter and interview. But even if they aren’t explicitly listed in the position description you can often do some research on the institutional history to fill out what is left unsaid. More below.
Institutional History
Now we’re getting into a place where humanities research skills can really shine. While the institutional history of a position often isn’t technically a specific part of the job description, it can teach you an awful lot. You can learn a lot by by exploring a series of questions:

Is this job a new job?
Is it re-hiring someone who left?
Is it for a grant?

You can often find some of this information by looking back at an organization’s website, on their blog, event pages, and more. Did someone seem to be in this role before that you can identify? While position re-hires are often opportunities to rethink what a particular job does, you can get a lot of valuable information by trying to flag exactly what the previous person in this position was doing. What kind of projects and events did they seem to be talking about? Those were likely their direct work responsibilities, and you can sometimes map those directly onto what the new job is asking of you. While you might not want to speak with full confidence in a cover letter, you could reference the history of the work this role seemed to do in a way that shows your familiarity with the institution. Similarly, if the job appears new, that would seem to suggest that the institution is committing to a new kind of work. Does the job correspond to specific initiatives or efforts? Sometimes this information will be in the job description directly. If the position is grant-funded you can often find that information either in the job description itself or in a grant announcement. If the grant was specifically awarded for a digital archiving project, you can assume that digital archiving skills are likely to be essential for it. Whereas if they are hiring for a DH generalist and list digital archives as just one of many responsibilities, you can assume that such work will just be one of many things you would take on. This kind of information can help you to assess how qualified you are, how to talk about specific elements from your background, and whether or not the job is for you.
On Job Ethics
Given my own convictions about labor transparency and ethics, I like to point out any potential issues with the jobs we are looking at. Are we looking at a job with a fixed term? Is it renewable? Is the salary livable? Does it seem to be doing too much? Is this a job that has been posted many times and never filled? Is the institution known to be toxic? Some of this will only come with experience in the field, but you can also give the students a bit of literacy in how to perform a smell test of a particular job ad. Of course, each individual will have their own set of circumstances to weigh when applying to any given position. And a one-year, fixed position might make a lot of sense for someone who is local. But I always want to make sure that students know the issues with jobs like these and how untenable they can be. We often don’t locally advertise jobs to our students in the Lab if they don’t pass the smell test unless we know of people whose specific goals and geographic limitations match up with a particular opportunity. At the very least, we want to make sure that students enter into the job search with eyes open.

There is much more to say, of course, but hopefully this quick writeup gives someone out there the tools they need to run this activity for themselves. I find that it helps to demystify the DH job market for students and helps them feel empowered to take that next step themselves. Perhaps most importantly, it starts to peel back obscuring layers of HR-ness and starts to make DH as a professional field a bit more transparent. That’s often the first step towards students feeling more invited into the professional community, and it can help them make a plan for developing the kind of institutional profile that they will need to apply successfully in the future.

What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. You can find book-related posts here. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email at bmw9t@virginia.edu.

This is a book about teachers, the labor they take on, and the structures that prevent them doing that work well. Our institutions often define teaching as something that happens in specific spaces, at specific times, and by specific people. In higher education, positions are often described with a common shorthand: “I teach a 2-2” or “I carry a 4-4.” The formulation describes both a calendar distribution as well as the supposed burden of teaching. Once your courses are done—your course load carried—you can get back to work. And the implicit encouragement is to spend less time on teaching and more time on your tenure file. The classroom is a space to be escaped. And when we describe some positions and institutions as teaching-intensive, however true the designation might be, we create boundaries. We suggest that some spaces are for teaching and some not.
Staff positions often distribute identification with the craft of teaching in a similar way. A Teaching and Learning Librarian might explicitly focus on classroom instruction. An Undergraduate Success Librarian might specialize in undergraduate outreach. Some roles might work with patrons directly to answer questions and roles, while others might think of themselves more as back of house and removed from the community. As with faculty positions and their associated teaching responsibilities, the ways we distribute staff labor can suggest separation between those who teach and those who do not. Some are in the classroom, while others might never set foot in it.
But we all teach.
It is understandable that someone without explicit classroom responsibilities might see themselves as disconnected from the act of teaching. But we do ourselves and our students a disservice when we fail to recognize the teaching that takes place across the institution by instructors in a range of different job titles. This book specifically speaks from the point of view of the teaching librarian, in part, because library positions entail a range of types of interaction. In some cases, librarians might design for-credit courses as part of the curriculum. But so much of the work of librarianship takes place in other spaces: reference consultations, collaborations with faculty members, one-on-one mentoring, workshops, one-off instructional sessions, and more. To be a librarian is to dance along the cracks of the institution, engaged in a thousand small teaching acts. Because of this, library perspectives are helpful for illuminating the cross-cutting impact of pedagogical decisions.
In the same way that teaching occurs throughout the university, staff positions like those in the library are useful case studies for discussing the pedagogies of institutions because they are regularly called upon to engage in the infrastructure of the university. Even if their job titles do not contain the word “administrator,” staff positions often make policy decisions that affect others. Digital humanities library positions, in particular, expose the ways in which teaching is an intersection of pedagogy and policy. Throughout this book I use the term teaching administrator to refer to individuals inhabiting such complicated roles in places of higher education. The term refers to those faculty and staff who inhabit administrative roles within their respective institution but also provide instruction in some capacity. I use the term administrator quite liberally here: it refers not only to directors or managers but more broadly to anyone engaged in the inner workings of university infrastructure and making policy decisions for it. Teaching, too, is construed broadly. Teaching takes place throughout the university, in its cracks and its hallways, in all manner of forms. The teaching administrator might direct a center but teach a course periodically. They might be a GIS Specialist who also runs regular workshops. Or they might be a developer engaged in paired programming with a student as part of a project development. Teaching administrators, no matter their specific job title, regularly find themselves implicated in and exerting force upon the various policies and norms that work on the institution and, in so doing, upon their embedded pedagogies.
More specifically, this is a book about all those principles, practices, and structures that intersect in a kind of pedagogy in the institution around them. When a local government reduces its budget, forcing secondary educators to dip into the own bank accounts to pay for classroom supplies—that is an observable act that impacts pedagogy. The material conditions of the classroom are changed based on administrative choices that are removed from the classroom. When the chairs in a public classroom are welded to the floor so as to prevent them from being moved from neatly arranged rows—that is a kind of pedagogy. The decision to bolt chairs to the ground may never have been made with actual instruction in mind, but it nonetheless affects the possibilities for learning in that space. The university encourages the idea that teaching takes place in the classroom, and this mode of thinking is a function of policy, power, and politics. When conversations are not explicitly about teachers and students—a kind of pedagogy is still being enacted. After all, an absence can still be noted and remarked upon. Why aren’t we talking about teaching? What does it say about what we value instead? A pedagogy.
This is a book about administrative choices like these, about the ways in which they help or harm the teachers in their midst. About all the myriad ways in which the work of education is routinely damaged by forces outside the classroom. This book argues that these institutional norms, policies, and structures act as embedded pedagogies that are operationalized for or against teachers and learners. Most often, as in the case of budgets cuts or prescriptive classroom spaces, these institutional pedagogies put teachers on the back foot, forced to teach in ways they might not otherwise do so in part out of a survival instinct. The first step to finding our way to the teaching we want to see in our work is to recognize the obstacles facing that labor, the pedagogies running counter to our own. And it can be especially difficult to notice the things affecting our teaching when they happen far outside the classroom, carried out by those who don’t consider themselves educators. By recasting institutional activities and actors in pedagogical terms, I hope to empower teachers to find their own path to enduring administrative difficulties even as they work to change them. These embedded pedagogies can be especially challenging to work against because the pressures they exert are often invisible to the teachers and learners in their midst. The first tactical decision we can make to counter them is to render them known.
Universities invest vast resources in making themselves known to their students, their communities, and their publics, from marketing to branding, communications to legislative testimony. In the process, though, this knowability is limited by design, as elite universities necessarily want themselves to be only so known, in specific ways, and by particular people. Institutions frequently obscure their actual administration in ways that distance teachers from their core functions. This web of policies, practices, and pressures shape our ability to teach and learn in seen and unseen ways, forming the network of embedded institutional pedagogies. By rendering these opaque practices transparent, we can empower educators to intervene in the forces affecting their ability to do the work of teaching.
In a certain way this book was also my own attempt to chart a pathway to survival in the face of the embedded pedagogies of my own institution. During a period of administrative upheaval at my place of work, blogging became a way for me to vent and reflect about the challenges I found for supporting student work. The audience I found for this writing seemed to be largely people in positions like mine: mid-career digital humanities administrators who had a hand in research, teaching, and administration. Positions like these are sometimes called “alt-ac” for the ways in which they offer a landing for graduate students outside of the traditional faculty path. Alt-ac staff often refer to themselves as scholar practitioners, a phrase that further serves to illuminate the fact that we often see administrative praxis itself as a subject for research and critique in its own right. The term “teaching administrator” is a similar riff, both a description of a hybridized identity and an attempt to instrumentalize it.
In moments of despair I sometimes referred to this manuscript as “the book I’m writing about bullshit and how to deal with it.” Invariably, others would respond with their own, similar frustrations at their own institutions. Embedded pedagogies carry power, in part, because they refuse to be seen for what they are. Writing this text is a first attempt at making legible the relationship between administrative policy and teaching in a way that makes them visible. To describe what I see so others can notice as well. To know and be known. To use the unique position of the teaching administrator to push back on the limited knowability of the institution and render legible its embedded pedagogies.

I’m realizing that if I don’t start combining things I will only ever blog about my class, so here I’m collecting notes on the last two weeks of “Data for the Rest of Us” on data description and collection into a single post. We got into the first real technical skills for the course as the students built out their understanding of the data production pipeline. The goal is for them to build datasets based around their own interests, and we took some real steps in that direction with these units.
We had previously developed a working definition of data, so we began our session on description by reviewing it briefly before quickly introducing metadata. We focused on its use: confusingly, metadata is often called data about data, but it’s more accurately thought of as data attached to other data that gives context, facilitates discovery, and enables analysis. We got to these topics by way of metadata in everyday life. We talked about the metadata categories used on driver’s licenses and by online booksellers to facilitate identification and search. And then we made our way to the Netflix page for a popular movie to show how fuzzy things can get. I pointed out the various objective, quantifiable data (release date, length) and asked the students to discuss the other kinds of qualitative data on the page. We discussed how the genre categories are often a combination of algorithmically generated and hand-selected tags. We talked about controlled vocabulary, introduced the concept of a folksonomy, and discussed the pros and cons of each. Relevant examples were hashtags on Twitter and shelving categories on Goodreads. We ended by discussing metadata standards with a particular focus on Dublin Core.
Then we moved to the actual main activity for the day that actually asked the students to practice creating descriptive metadata. I set out three stacks of materials and asked them in groups to create a spreadsheet describing them. Each set of materials had a few types of items:

A set of books that were easy to describe
A zine
A book by George Eliot
A book by Haruki Murakami (to introduce concepts of translation)
One of a handful of especially challenging objects:
    
a CD of regional GIS information
the deck-of-cards novel Riding SideSaddle by Miriam Suzanne
the Surviving Design Projects deck



I had the students go through and describe their objects in groups using Dublin Core, fielded questions as they came up, and then rotated the unusual objects so that each group had seen them all. I periodically asked discoverability questions that prompted the students to rethink how they were organizing their data such as “which of you has a book by Mary Ann Evans?” The answer, of course, is that they all had a book by George Eliot. We talked about where that information should go in their dataset and discussed the individual choices made by different groups to solve these problems. We then touched on Riding SideSaddle specifically, which gave every group difficulty. Was the novel a genre? A format? A fuzzy concept? Their homework to pull all this together by using Dublin Core to create a small dataset that described 10 different examples of an interest of theirs.
The following class was about data collection, a topic I was especially excited about. We talked broadly about why we want to gather that in the first place:

It’s not being done!
To make the world better
To make something you care about last
Because otherwise someone else will do it instead/in spite of you

And then we discussed how to do so:

Surveys
Crowdsourcing
Web scraping
APIs
Ethics questions and IRB

Throughout, my main takeaway was that there is a wealth of stuff out there not being gathered. Any person can take on the task of gathering ephemeral content, sustaining, and analyzing it. But we have to be careful, ethical, and thoughtful about how we do so.
The centerpiece of the class was a workshop on webscraping as a method for collecting web data. I love teaching students how to scrape because I still remember how earth shattering it felt to learn how to do for the first time. So much stuff out there! And you can reach out to touch and handle it! I don’t assume any programming knowledge in the course, so I looked around for point-and-click scraping tools that might work for a one-off workshop. I landed on webscraper.io, a freemium tool that runs as an extension in Chrome. It’s very slick and powerful for this sort of sandbox work. The free version runs locally in your browser, so not good for full-on, large-scale work. But it requires very little technical knowledge, which made it work well for my purposes. I walked the students through how to scrape the Scholars’ Lab blog, and then I gave them a few other sites to practice with:

https://books.toscrape.com/
https://quotes.toscrape.com/
https://webscraper.io/test-sites

Their homework was to scrape another sandbox example and come up with ideas for real scraping projects. They’ve done great work with these scaffolding assignments that are building towards pitches for their final projects, and I’m excited to see where they go.
A few other reflections:

I keep having the students make spreadsheets to work with, and every time the students lose five minutes at the beginning of each activity as they create a blank spreadsheet and share their email addresses with each other. I should really create some blank spreadsheets ahead of time for them to reuse. It’s a small thing, but a few minutes each class really add up. And it often feels like the activities have a slow burn to really get going as the students start out engaging in tedious housekeeping.
One small thing I’ve been interested in this semester: everyone in the class is majoring or minoring in STEM in some way. I’m finding that I have to recalibrate a lot of my expectations. For example, my own background as a teacher of literature makes me want to gear everything towards discussion in a way that feels unusual to the students. But the students are excelling with the hands-on activities and technical work. I’m finding that I need to lecture more than normal, but also that I can go deeper on some of the technical questions than I might otherwise.

As always, the slide decks I’ve put together are all available on the course website.

I keep my running CV on my website for a few reasons. It keeps everything in one place. It’s handy to point students towards when they have questions about how to list things on their own CV. It lets me pull in some quick stats on my blog posts using Jekyll. But I’ve always run into problems when it comes time to submit my CV as an actual document. Copying the page over to Microsoft Word brings in all the detritus of my web styling and structure, and I have to dutifully edit those elements out before submission.
I described this problem to Jeremy Boggs, our Head of R&D, and he immediately suggested that I look into making a print stylesheet for my CV page. I knew you could use CSS to style the ways your web page gets printed, but I’d never actually played around with it before. Now I’ve got things going such that I have far less to do when I go to submit my CV. This post documents that process.
The first thing I needed to do was get a way to preview what I was looking at. By default, your developer environment won’t render your print styles unless you go to print a page and look at the preview that pops up. I followed this set of instructions for getting Google Chrome to emulate my print styles in the browser as I worked.
Now that I can see my work, my first real step is to make a new print stylesheet and link it to my site in the head of my default template. This print stylesheet is fairly specialized to a single page, so I wrap the reference in an if statement so that it is only included on that particular page.
_includes/head.html
{% if page.title == "CV" %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/styles/print.css">
{% endif %}

Now that the stylesheet is included, I start to build up a styles/print.css file one piece at a time based on the things I want to change. First off was hiding web-only materials like the nav bar and the masthead.
styles/print.css
  /* Hide web-only content  */
  header, nav, h1.page-title, #web-title{
    display: none;
  }

But I actually do want some material as a masthead. I implement this by actually having some content on the web that is only rendered to the browser if it is printed. This becomes a part of the masthead, contained in my default layout for my jekyll site.
_layouts/default.html
<div class="print-only" id="print-title">Brandon Walsh | walsh.brandon.michael@gmail.com | @walshbr</div>

And then it only appears when printed by specifying a print-only class for those elements that I only want when printing.
styles/print.css
  .print-only{
    /* Display print-only content */
    display: block;
  }

The web version of my CV does not span the whole width of the page, which is good for readability on the web but a problem when printing. So these settings create a more typical one-inch margin for the document. Another interesting issue I ran into was that some printers by default will include metadata - date, page number, time - on the page for printing. The margin settings below cut that off.
styles/print.css
  div.container.content {
    /* normalize content sizing for printing */
    max-width: none !important;
  }

  @page {
    /* hide printer-specific information that would otherwise get added */
    margin:0;
    padding: 1in;
  }

And then finally I got down to the actual task of setting up some basic stylings that make it a little less web and a little more print. I switch fonts, change the text size, and revert to default URL text decorations for the sake of the genre. In the past I’ve found that my link styles, especially, look very strange when copied over to a print document.
styles/print.css
  html, h2, h3, #print-title{
    /* set print-ready font and text size */
      font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; 
      font-size: 12px;
  }

  a{
    /* Normalize URL colors */
      text-decoration: underline;
      color: blue;
  }

One stretch goal that I haven’t fully implemented: I commonly need a quick way to cut my CV down. There’s no good way to do it programmatically with any real level of precision, but Jeremy showed me how to do a rough cut that works well in a pinch. I’m using Jekyll by default, which will give ID’s to all of my headers that match the titles. Jeremy showed me how to use CSS selectors to selectively hide whole batches of content based on those ID’s. The following CSS would hide all of my service commitments. Not really super useful to do a lot of, but maybe helpful to know about!
styles/print.css
/* example for how to hide specific sections */
/* 
h2#professional-service-and-affiliations,
h2#professional-service-and-affiliations+ul,
h3#local-service-washington-and-lee,
h3#local-service-washington-and-lee+ul,
h3#local-service-university-of-virginia+ul{
  display:none;
} */

That’s it for now. Much more that I could do, but this serves my needs nicely. And here’s a quick side-by-side of the first printed page to see how the new print.css sheet stacks up.
First the original print, which is a pretty close copy of the web version:

And now the new one with a print stylesheet incorporated. Much more usable as a CV! I could save it as a PDF to submit.

I’ve pasted the full contents of all the relevant files as they stand in case you’re interested in replicating.
_includes/head.html
{% if page.title == "CV" %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/styles/print.css">
{% endif %}

_layouts/default.html
<div class="print-only" id="print-title">Brandon Walsh | walsh.brandon.michael@gmail.com | @walshbr</div>

styles/print.css
@media print {
  
  /* Hide web-only content  */
  header, nav, h1.page-title, #web-title{
    display: none;
  }

  .print-only{
    /* Display print-only content */
    display: block;
  }

  div.container.content {
    /* normalize content sizing for printing */
    max-width: none !important;
  }

  @page {
    /* hide printer-specific information that would otherwise get added */
    margin:0;
    padding: 1in;
  }

Amanda Visconti and I are starting a series of process experiments with public writing, where the goal is to experiment with format and mode while still attempting to get a public piece done in a single hour. For this first session we sat together, read some intentions and affirmations to set the tone, and then pulled from the Oblique Strategies card deck to get a prompt for us each to write on. The card Amanda chose hit me in the gut:
What mistakes did you make last time?
Given everything going on in the news right now, it’s impossible not to read this in light of the new presidential administration, which has just released a flurry of executive actions and destabilizing edicts designed to harm, divide, and panic. It feels like history rhyming, this time with capital letters. The first Trump administration felt excruciating and devastating in all sorts of ways, and this one already feels worse. I have been thinking endlessly about the memory of the last time, whether or not the work that we do in digital humanities matters in this context, and how we might make it matter more. It’s easy to despair.
What mistakes did you make last time?
In some ways, the quote rings to me of the cruelty of living in the past—exactly the sort of thing my therapist tells me not to do. “Don’t ruminate,” she would say, warning me against endlessly turning over in my mind the mistakes I made, the alternate timelines that didn’t manifest. It’s not enough to just warn oneself against worrying about past mistakes, though, and my therapist always goes on: “instead lean into your toolkit and all the work you have done to prepare yourself to deal with these challenging situations.” You are prepared for this. It is not the same, because you are not the same.
What mistakes did you make last time?
This is not business as usual, but the business of the usual carries on. The sun still rises. Care still must be given to those who need it. Work must still be done. There is an absurdity to this disconnect while the world increasingly aches with fire, death, and pain. I see in the card an invitation to the future, to dream of a better world than the one we have, to think beyond mistakes and towards rewriting the equation by different rules. We all have levers to pull to work against these forces each day. Last time was different because I was different. This difference can multiply. The math of dreamers, creating a world beyond the present crisis through the mundane work of small, everyday acts.
Who were you last time? Who are you now? Who will you be tomorrow?
Dream math. Pencils ready.

Snow is on the ground, but I bundled up to make it to campus for week two of “Data for the Rest of Us,” a semester-long, two-credit introduction to data literacy from a humanities perspective. The general arc of the course takes students through all parts of the data construction pipeline and culminates in small groups developing datasets based around their own interests to share back with the class. This week’s topic was “Data Identification,” which I structured in two segments: theory and practice.
First, we developed a working definition of what qualifies as data. Core to this was the Wikipedia page for data, which offers a neat and actionable summary in the first paragraph: “Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə, US also /ˈdætə/ DAT-ə) are a collection of discrete or continuous values that convey information, describing the quantity, quality, fact, statistics, other basic units of meaning, or simply sequences of symbols that may be further interpreted formally.”
For our purposes, I simplified this definition as containing three key elements. Data is…

A collection
of units of meaning
that may be interpreted formally.

We discussed each of these pieces separately:

What counts as a collection? Who is doing the collecting? What does it mean to arrange things together? What structures facilitate collection or collecting? When does data become a dataset?
What counts as a unit of meaning? What is meaning in the humanities? What are the humanities anyway? What kinds of meaning units have we used in the past week?
What do we mean by formal interpretation? In this case, I specifically referred to the kinds of interpretation made possible by computers. We talked about what computers are good at, what they are bad at, and the kinds of compromises we might have to make to move between the two. We also talked about the kinds of formal interpretations that are possible: mapping, pattern recognition, averages, counting, and more.

In the second phase of the course, we practiced putting this definition into practice. I presented a series of objects to the students and asked them to apply our definition to it. Did this count as data on our terms? That is…was it a collection of meaningful information that could interpreted quantitatively? Why or why not? What units of information were there that could become data? How would we structure things if we wanted to convert this into data as defined above, such that we could work with it computationally?
We looked at:

A spreadsheet with stuff in it
An empty spreadsheet
An apple watch loaded with personal metrics
A diagram of cell phone metadata describing call counts, shortest paths between phones
data structures
A bookcase with books in it
The bible opened to a particular page
A movie poster
A set of movie posters
A Wikipedia page about a Civil War battle
A spreadsheet full of information about twentieth-century wars
The front page of Vogue

Some conversations were less lively, but there were some objects that brought out great observations. With the Bible, for example, students noted how certain structural elements like chapter number, verse number, and page number might be interesting units of meaning you might want to preserve. And they got there by noting how you cite material from it. I also talked a bit about the OCR process by way of orienting them towards the path by which a physical object might become a collection of words in a plain text file.
The other “this is not a pipe” moment came when I asked the students to talk about what was contained in a movie poster. After they named all the textual elements of the image, I pulled up the CSS Color Picker tool and talked about how images are also specific organizations of color data. So in addition to the textual information we understood as people, the computer was understanding things on a very visual level and in very quantified terms. This made a nice link to the Robots Reading Vogue project and brought out a discussion of how we can make meaningful interpretations from visual information.
We closed with a short discussion of “On Missing Data Sets” by way of encouraging the students to think about what is out there, what is not, and the kinds of values, systems, and resources that go into deciding what is collected and what is not. For homework, the students have to brainstorm some datasets that don’t exist that they are interested in. I’m, frankly, a little suspicious of how successful they will be at this. It seems very hard to me! But I wanted to throw them the challenge to see how they do. Even if they struggle mightily I think it will be worthwhile.
If I had to run this particular class again, I probably would divide the class into smaller groups to help facilitate discussion. We ultimately got where I wanted to go, but my sense was that the students might have needed a bit more help from me structuring the discussion to get there. I think that might have been accomplished by flipping the format - rather than a group discussion about particular topics and images, I would give each group a set of images and a set of questions to answer about them before we came back to discuss. I’m still finding my way in this class of all STEM students since I’m used to exclusively teaching humanities majors.
Overall, the class discussion sent the students into something of an existential tailspin. Is it data? Yes. But also no. Could be! Depends on how much work you want to put into the question. And much more of that work is to come.

This semester, I’m teaching an undergraduate course at UVA called “Data for the Rest of Us.” The course is, broadly, an attempt to introduce principles and practices of critical data literacy to students who might otherwise find full-blow data science intimidating. I’ve published the whole course online, and I’ll likely be posting some reflections off and on as the course proceeds. The centerpiece of the course is the group construction of a dataset and associated narrative description based on their research interests, an outcome that I’m largely basing on Responsible Datasets in Context. Much more to say about the design of the course as a whole, but I wanted to document a little about the first day today. If RDiC is where the inspiration for the course came from, I’ve had the first day’s activity in my head just as long. I planned to introduce myself and the course in a few minutes before quickly shifting gears into something I called “We Data.” Here’s the prompt:

We Data: An Icebreaking Activity
I want to get to know you. In the spirit of the course, your job is to make a dataset about yourselves to share back with me. You have 45 minutes in which to do so. You have to hit the following buckets.

Identify your data

Who are you?


Describe your data

What are you interested in describing as a part of your dataset? What are you not?


Collect

Gather your data in one place.


Clean

Edit the dataset so that it’s in a presentable, consistent format.


Analyze

What stories are in your dataset?


Distribute

How will you share it back to me?



Some advice

Not everyone has to work on the same things! Divide up.
Use what you have.
Don’t spend so much time talking. Do.


The goal was to introduce the students to the pipeline we will follow in the course as we develop skills in data management and construction: Identification, Description, Collection, Cleaning, Analysis, Distribution. These are the units the course follows, so the activity mirrors the work they will do on their final project while introducing some of the same questions and topics. I also hoped it would serve a lot of the same function as a more traditional set of icebreakers, with the added hope that the activity would feel a little more connected to the course than such things might otherwise.
I thought it went pretty well all things considered! A few thoughts and reflections follow while they are fresh in my mind:

I mostly spent the 45 minutes of the activity floating among the groups, using the opportunity to practice names, get to know each group, and engage with students about their responses. I also took care to watch the clock and encourage people to move on to different parts of the activity’s pipeline at certain stages.
The students took some prodding to talk as a group rather than spend the time quietly inputting things in sheets on their own. But this also might be due to the fact that the students spent a few minutes at the start setting up Google Sheets to collaborate on—once everyone had everyone’s email addresses they were off.
Given the way the course was pitched, I expected some folks to have questions about what a dataset was. I was a bit surprised to see how quickly people immediately jumped to Google Sheets. It turned out that the vast majority of my students come from STEM or the social sciences, and this disciplinary background might have something to do with how quickly and easily they dove right into working on the project.
As I had hoped, the students started with objective facts (siblings, name, major, etc.). As time wore on, they found their way to much more subjective and interesting questions (favorite book, favorite tv show, favorite snack). Some even wound up in philosophical territory: “what would be your answer to the trolley problem?”
The students noted that much of their data wound up being a mix of textual and numerical information, though one group shared dog photos in the spreadsheet. I might have a hand in encouraging this delightful bit of chaos.
For the analytical section, the students mostly narrated their way through the stories that their group’s datasets told about themselves. But one group—admittedly the one that happened to have two stats majors—actually produced graphs! They shared some scatter plots, pie charts, and even showed a map where they plotted their hometowns.

The activity concluded with the students sharing back their group’s datasets and analysis with each other. I followed this with a general discussion of the activity using the following guiding questions:

What is data?
What is it not?
What was hard?
What did you learn?
How did it feel to represent yourselves in this way?

One thing that came up was the students’ willingness to share personal data and not worry too much about it. For one, nothing they shared was all that sensitive. Several students connected this comfort to the general pervasiveness of technological surveillance in their daily life. If just about anything can be found online, why sweat any small thing too much? Even knowing that this was a specific response to an isolated activity, the conversation was an interesting window into how differently younger generations view privacy and personal data.
I’ll definitely be using a version of the same activity in future semesters. Onward!

One thing that helped me a lot as a graduate student was the Scholars’ Lab’s willingness to aid me in preparing for job interviews. I had no idea what to expect, so the practice was hugely beneficial for me—as was the coaching in what a mock interview might look like at all. Now that I’m on the other side of the table and offering them myself, I thought I would document how I run mock interviews in case the information is useful for others.
The Process
You’ll first want to assemble 1-2 other interviewers for your mock committee. Part of the strangeness of interviews is the discomfort of managing a one-sided conversation. You’ll want to mirror that for students if you can. Since interview—and, accordingly, mock interview—requests come up very last minute, it’s helpful to know who in your community might be interested in participating in the process. I often find staff are very happy to accommodate these last-minute requests once they have done them once, but giving them a bit of a heads up that they are in the pool of potential interviewers can help encourage participation in the future. I also try to select people likely to be familiar with the kind of job in question, so pre-gathering a pool of participants can help you identify areas in which you could use some help.
Once you have the group together, share the following documents with them ahead of time:

the position description
the student’s job materials
the plan for the mock interview (including questions to ask)

In an ideal world the committee will familiarize themselves with all the relevant materials, though since these things are often scheduled last minute I never assume this is the case. I usually plan to convey a lot of the information verbally when we meet as a committee.
Schedule 90 minutes for the mock interview, though 60 minutes will work if necessary. I typically use this format:

10 minutes to brief on the plan for the session and give general interview thoughts
60 minutes for the mock interview
20 minutes to debrief, give feedback, and discuss

From there you should be ready to carry out the mock. More guidance follows about how to facilitate each specific part of the interview process for your student and your collaborators.
Part 1 of the Interview: Discussion of the Mock Plan
Since most students come to us without much experience at all interviewing, let alone for the subset of alt-ac or DH positions, I typically open with just a few minutes discussing interviews in general. I often note that these types of positions are not quite full academic positions and not quite standard tech jobs. Discussing the posting ahead of time might help to give students some sense of what they can expect, as each position is unique. For example, postdoctoral positions come in many flavors. Some might be more like pre-faculty fellowships, with a heavy focus on personal research in addition to staff responsibilities. Others might be more flavored as pre-staff positions with limited research time. Temper expectations accordingly with a bit of context about the position.
Plan to mirror the format of the interview—phone, Zoom, or in-person. It’s important to practice as though it were the real thing. Each format is awful in ways that can’t be anticipated ahead of time. I typically discuss the particular weirdness of the selected format with the student quite frankly. I have seen pretty shocking things in the background of zoom interviews before. It happens. Best not to be thrown but also keep in mind how you can minimize the risks of such things for yourself.
Many formal searches have HR requirements that require interviewers to ask the same questions of each candidate. These rules carry a lot of ramifications. Committee members might ask follow-up questions, but back and forth conversation is likely to be minimal. Interviewers might aggressively be taking notes while you talk. The committee will typically move person by person down the line and each read questions from a prepared list. These procedures can give the feeling that you have no real rapport with the people in the room because you get little response visually or verbally to much of what you say. All of this is to say: the awkwardness is not you. It is almost always a reflection of the format, where people are trying to figure out who should go when, who should say what, what to do next, etc. Expect it.
I usually close by asking the student to take the mock as seriously as they would a real interview, up to and including trying their best to stumble through answers as they would for the real thing. This means avoiding the temptation to pass on any one question with a response like “well I should probably think about that more.” Just do your best—we can discuss later.
Part 2 of the Interview: The Mock Itself
The bulk of the mock is spent on the actual interview. I usually offer a few options for the mock committee. Questions can be drawn from experience and made up on the spot if they like, but I also provide a bank of examples based around different topics for my colleagues to use if necessary. During the mock, we alternate who is asking questions to mimic the odd experience of interviewing by committee. And we try to draw from across a spectrum of topics. What follows is an example list of questions I have shared with colleagues in the past. Note the first and last questions common to each mock, followed by a series of different categories we can move among at will.

First Question
    
What drew you to this position? Why this place?


Position-specific Questions:
    
We are really concerned about X problem local to us. How would you address it? (I often research for five minutes and come up with something ahead of time.)
We want to get more undergrads involved. How would you do that?
How do you get faculty to collaborate meaningfully with staff?
Do you want to use this as a faculty steppingstone (ideally yes or no depending on the position)? How can we help?


Research Questions
    
Describe your research and what you think of as your primary intervention.
How does your dissertation engage in digital humanities?
If you had to construct a through line for your work—dissertation through extra-curricular activities—what would it be?
What is your next big project? (might be book, a DH project, etc.)


Teaching Questions
    
What is your vision for pedagogy (especially re: DH) and how we might integrate it here?
How might that be translated to a curriculum or minor?
How does DH inform your approach to teaching?
What DH teaching have you done?
If you were to teach a DH course for us what would it be?
What kind of support do you need for teaching?


Community Questions
    
How do you approach collaboration? (push to talk about both technical and project management strategies)
What experience do you have with grant writing? One problem we have is that when we write grants then the money ends. What do you do about that? How could you have this position help us (and you) grow?
How do you bring students into your program when you’re a multidisciplinary org like ours?
How do you build community and visibility on campus?


Technical Questions
    
We are interested in how you would begin to design a digital archive. Talk us through it.
Hand a list of dates that have been formatted differently - What do you see here? Why does this matter? How would you address it? (an actual interview question I had once!)
What did you learn from your biggest technical failure?


Last Question
    
Do you have any questions for us?



I could go on and on, but these are just meant as a starting point. I typically flavor the questions a bit towards the specific job in question. For example, a DH Developer mock might have more technical questions than an interview for a DH Specialist. But I do think giving a broad spectrum of questions, difficulties, and topics can be helpful for students as they try to figure out what they can expect. Often just seeing a big list of example questions like this can be enough to spark a student’s imagination as they continue to prep on their own.
Part 3 of the Interview: The Mock Debrief
Perhaps the most helpful piece of the mock is the feedback that students will receive from the committee. Each person will have their own things that they noticed, but I often find that there are a few points that students might especially need to hear advice on.
Because students often feel like imposters, it can be easy to overwhelm them with feedback. So, we often open debrief sessions simply by encouraging them. They survived. They can do this. Be careful to consider—and frame—your advice in the context of the circumstances. If the actual interview is the next day, a student cannot expect to change their personality wholesale based on your feedback—and advice to do so might just make the student panic. Instead, emphasize those things that feel doable and learnable in the time allotted.
One way to do this is to start with the good that you noticed in the mock performance. Were there specific questions they responded well to? Can you help them to extrapolate that performance to a more generalized approach? Were there responses where they felt particularly light on their feet? It’s easy to focus on the bad, so the students might need your help seeing their strengths. And opening with these moments can offer a healthy frame for the conversation to follow.
Students often lack confidence in their own experiences and their ability to speak from them to the job at hand. I always encourage students to think about their current identities as students as a kind of superpower. Staff and faculty putting together DH programming often have to work hard to reach out to students just like them. They’re living it! It’s just a matter of reframing their own experiences as expertise. What has worked for them in their own DH education? What has not? What lessons could they take elsewhere? They often know more than they might think!
I could offer much more in the way of specific advice that comes up repeatedly for students interviewing for DH jobs: contextualizing themselves as a PhD graduate applying for library work, saying enough for a particular question, saying too much, recognizing those questions that feel like traps, etc. But really I would just trust yourself and your students. In the same way that your students are capable of shining but might need the help to see it, I am confident that someone who has read this far in a post on this topic will have good instincts about what to share with a student about their interview performance.
Share all notes, guides, and questions (including those you didn’t ask) after the fact with the students for their own prep work. Follow up with the student close to the date and afterwards, both to encourage them and to find out how to better mirror the mock format to what they saw in reality.
Last Caveats
Some advice for readers of this post: know your own limits. I only have participated in so many kinds of search committees. Those I have served on primarily pertained to digital humanities, alt-ac, or library jobs. Other institutional contexts and types of positions will look different, in ways I cannot know. When I get a request for something more out of my wheelhouse—like a faculty position or an industry gig—I will try to pull in folks with experience in those contexts. Your university might also have a career center that could offer some advice on certain kinds of positions. Graduate students might not be their usual clientele, though, so they might need some orientation to the kinds of positions as well. I am always transparent with students about the limitations of my own experience and where they might need to look for advice from others.
Even with this final warning to recognize the limitations of your experiences and resources, I would encourage you to think expansively about how you can gather what you do have into useful professional development experiences for students. Students need all the help they can get as they try to apply for a broad range of opportunities in a toxic and unsettled job market. Your students will benefit from the effort you put into helping them prepare, especially for alt-ac or digital humanities positions that might feel a bit unusual for those less familiar with them.

Co-teaching is a promise. To each other. To yourself. To believe. To trust. To support. To help. To heal.
Co-teaching is not a weapon. Co-teaching is a gift.
Co-teaching is an act of love. It is not a competition.
Co-teaching is not a zero sum game.
Co-teaching is to see the world through the eyes of another. The classroom. Yourself.
Co-teaching is an act of vulnerability. To teach is to expose yourself.
Co-teaching is to invite someone in.
Co-teaching is an act of empathy.
Co-teaching is to extend your arms openly. It is not pushing someone away.
Co-teaching is a beautiful game. It is not a game of chance.
To teach is to learn. To co-teach is to learn to teach.
Co-teaching is embracing the unknown. To find yourself in the shoes of another.
To co-teach is to recognize that you have power.

I remember very clearly my flight back from the 2016 DLF Forum. I had presented with Mackenzie Brooks on open writing for Small Liberal Arts Colleges. My Facebook feed was full of photos of people voting in the US presidential election. Long lines. People putting one foot in front of another to vote. I flew back home on election night, and I remember the strange way that people in the airport started gathering around the television watching what was happening. Normally, people kept to themselves. That night, the anxiety in the air was palpable. As was the growing excitement (DLF, after all, was in Wisconsin that year). I remember the panic I felt flying and not knowing what would wait for me when we landed. When I got in my car and turned on NPR in a rush at 2:00 AM I first heard the results. I remember not being able to sleep.
In 2024, history rhymed. Conference week? Check. The ACH conference was the week of the election, and for months we had all wondered what the environment would feel like in the aftermath. We found out. Election results that were unexpected and, yet, all too expected? Check. At least this time I wasn’t on a flight: I could climb under the covers in my pajamas between sessions of the online conference.
I wrote both of my talks for this month’s ACH conference when Trump was just a second candidate. I helped to coordinate a workshop on articulating and defending the values at the core of your work with a whole raft of brilliant folks: Amanda Visconti, Caitlin Pollock, Pamella Lach, Kate Ozment, and Crystal Luo. Later that night, I gave a paper on speculative digital pedagogies with Seanna Viechweg, where we talked about the pasts, presents, and futures of imagination in the DH classroom. All of this work felt suddenly more urgent than ever. But I gave these talks in a stupor. As I spoke about advocacy and values I could not help but wonder about the limits and reaches of certain types of power. As I discussed the imagination and the future, I could not stop thinking about the past.
Did I still believe in what I was saying?
I’ve been thinking a lot about where I was eight years ago and where I am today. I’ve been at the Scholars’ Lab seven and a half years—roughly the span of the first Trump and the Biden presidencies. In that time, I have supervised dozens of students on a variety of projects. I have comforted them as they cried. Helped find them funding to survive. Worked to prepare them for and find them jobs. Advocated for them in spaces large and small. Organized alongside them in our wall-to-wall union. For some, this work helped. For others, it did not, and I remember every person for whom something didn’t pan out. I’ve learned hard lessons about the limits of my own ability to change things, and at times I’ve described the work as trying to steer a yacht through an obstacle course. You can correct the course slightly, but only so much. I’ve hit lots of buoys.
I believe in this work. I believe it has mattered. But eight years later I will confess to questioning a lot of its power. The words I was about to read to a digital space filled with other dazed people, all zooming in from their own rooms. They felt so small and insignificant. What good were my little words in the face of a country filled with hate, ready to visit and revisit new horrors on its population and on the world?
I recognize my own positionality. I am a cis white man with a comfortable job and salary. I do not face the same dangers to my bodily, financial, and political autonomy as so many who are most likely to be impacted by the new administration. Even so, I have so much fear. For my son’s future in a vaccine-skeptical world. For my LGBTQ friends and family who are worried about access to life-saving medication or the freedom to exist. For the immigrants in my life who are scared for their safety. My own anxieties and fears are a drop in the ocean, much wider and more vast.
As I was searching around for meaning and energy in the days following the election, I came across a few lights that I’ve been clinging to. As Josh Rezek posted on BlueSky, “Writing is part of surviving this! Your own and everyone else’s!” And my dear friend and collaborator Amanda Visconti shared a post by Brian LaRossa containing “a short thread full of words from people who are smarter than me about the vital role that artists play in society generally, and doubly so in the face of authoritarian regimes.” I don’t have any illusions that my own writing is as important or radical as the pieces linked in that thread. Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin. These are real heroes. I should be so lucky as to write anything a scrap as meaningful as what they produced. But these examples are helping me think less about where I was eight years in the past and more about where I want to be in the future. About the writer, teacher, and advocate that I want to continue growing into. And those heroes exist in the present, too, closer to home. Some of the most helpful conversations I have had in the week since the election have been with a pair of brilliant students with whom I share a DH writing group. They are more committed than ever to the pursuit of a better world. They teach me, as always, how to be better and how to help. And the work they produced these past few weeks moved me to tears (though I am a softy, to be fair).
By complete and total happenstance this is my hundredth post on my personal blog. Lots of little words. This post, then, is less a statement for others than it is for myself. A commitment to keep going in the face of fear. To keep growing. I will keep recognizing the limits of words and work to act beyond them. But I will also try to hold in my heart the belief that words carry power. So a week after the election and a bit better rested here I am. Putting one word after another. And recommitting myself to the regular practice of doing so.

The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. Consistent collaboration and engagement with the Scholars’ Lab community and staff is expected through the year. While residence on Grounds during the fellowship can help facilitate this, it is not required. Those who need to live elsewhere with periodic trips to campus should include in their cover letter a plan for how to ensure regular progress on the fellowship project.
We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $25,972 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $25,972 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
    
The funding packages for non-GSAS students operate on a different funding cycle and with different terms. As such, students outside of GSAS should confirm their eligibility with the Lab and their program director prior to applying.


Previously being a Praxis Fellow is not required. Nor is it a barrier. Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The student’s Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student’s application.
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;

The following is a short, internal lightning talk I gave to UVA Library staff as a part of the Library’s Open Access Week in fall 2024.

Hello! My name is Brandon Walsh, and I’m Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, one of the twin branches of the UVA Library’s Digital Humanities Center. I was asked to talk a bit about my work in open pedagogy as it intersects with digital humanities, a big baggy field in which we’re constantly confronting what we don’t know and helping others to do the same. From my earliest days working in DH, way back when I was a student myself in the Lab and in the Library, I was drawn to this pedagogical through line. The sheer importance of learning to it all. And this, in turn, has deeply informed how I approach Open with my students.
Always learning. Always teaching.
Together.
My practice of open digital pedagogy is informed by three intertwining principles:

Humanities students see themselves as imposters more often than not, particularly when it comes to technical concepts and methods.
Students are experts in teaching and learning. There is no one better equipped to explain something complicated than a person who has just learned it.
The labor of teaching and learning is often invisible.

My whole career has been about the commingling of these three concepts when it comes to pedagogy—self-confidence, expertise, and visibility.
Open has been the space in which they meet.
Often, this takes the shape of co-authored OER materials with my students. I co-wrote A Humanist’s Cookbook for Natural Language Processing in Python with Rebecca Bultman, then a UVA religious studies PhD. When I was a postdoc at Washington and Lee University, I co-wrote a course book on text analysis with Sarah Horowitz, a faculty collaborator who I was co-teaching with at the time. In each case, the process of co-writing, I hoped, would offer my partners a space to teach themselves something about the topic as well as the technical stack that it took to make it. They learned the terminal, Python, text analysis, markdown, version control, and more. I, in turn, learned to be a better teacher: the materials were much improved by having them involved as partners. The outcomes also presented this labor—the work of teaching and learning—in a space that was available to other learners and also CV-friendly. By positioning these student collaborators as co-writers, co-experts, I hoped to gently affirm that they were more than capable of doing this work. And the work aimed to present this new material in a space that would be more comfortable for humanists, grounding the learning process in public writing and conversation as opposed to pounding away at a programming script.
The production of open materials, by, for, and with students like these has always been a core part of my DH practice. Sometimes, as with these examples, the result explicitly looks like OER, but it’s often just about asking students to write in public about the process of teaching and learning. They teach themselves new techniques, develop workshops for each other, and document the teaching materials for others.  My students use open writing as a means of imagining into existence the kind of scholars they want to be on their own terms—they don’t wait for academic publishers to credential them accordingly. The examples I used here were specific to me, but virtually every member of the Scholars’ Lab staff is engaged in this work in some capacity. We want our students to see the Lab and the Library as spaces that see them for who they are—worthy and capable even as they are learning.
All of this is to say that open pedagogy for me means treating students as true partners in the production of scholarly knowledge. They teach me as much as I them, and it happens in public. I’ll close with a quotation by Nicholas Payton, a jazz hero of mine. It’s one I sit with every day.
“There are no great teachers, only great students who give tools to other students.”

This year, I am working with Rachel Retica and Seanna Viechweg on a digital pedagogy reading group (join us!). Our plan is to run a yearlong series of sessions, rotating who is in charge of any one meeting, as a means of giving each of us practice teaching at the same time that we’re discussing it. My first session focused on digital pedagogy and labor. Rachel’s session will focus on reading, interpretation and information literacy, and Seanna will run her session as a discussion of culturally responsive pedagogy. As a part of this work, we’ll also be aiming to work up a collectively authored piece at the end of the year. As we’re still in the brainstorming phase now, we decided to take on a series of writing prompts to gather some raw material to discuss our own orientations to this work.
Our first: what’s your origin story?
It was hard for me to come up with a single answer to the question, so I opted for a kind of refracting approach. Many sketches instead of a single one. I could not think of just one origin story, so I chose many. I wrote these all in chronological order, but I scrambled them at random to present them here. After all, I’m still that kid who cried in a trumpet lesson and skipped class in college, even now when I’m more often teacher than student. I’ll leave off reflections on them for another post.
What is your origin story with digital pedagogy? What brought you to it?
I am a student. I am quiet in class. I know whether or not I speak is tied to my grade, but I feel intense anxiety over this fact. It gets in the way of me speaking.
I am fresh out of my graduate fellowship in DH at the Scholars’ Lab, co-teaching humanities programming with Wayne Graham at HILT. I mention that there is a job in the region I want to apply for but don’t feel qualified. He tells me that I absolutely am qualified. That job is at W&L.
I am a graduate fellow in the Scholars’ Lab. The staff ask us to volunteer for roles on a collaborative project. They ask, “What do you want to learn?” rather than “What do you think you are good at?”
I am crying on an overlook on Afton Mountain. It’s the very last day that I will be commuting back to Charlottesville from my postdoc at Washington and Lee University. I have loved my time there, but the drive has been eating away at me in ways I did not understand. I won’t have to do it any longer.
I am a graduate student at UVA. I ask if I can use a laptop in the Scholars’ Lab. One of the staff responds with a laugh: “Of course - we’re not fascists.” I just came from an English department lecture in which they were banned.
I am crying in my weekly trumpet lesson. My teacher Paul Neebe gives me two pieces of advice. All bad sound can become good sound. The mistake I am making is thinking I will stay the same if I work at improving something.
I am a fourth grader trying to learn how to type. Our instructor teaches us about home row and how to use it to guide our fingers across the keyboard. It never sticks, and to this day I still use a whacky self-taught version of typing that usually involves me elevating my right pinky for no other reason than habit.
I am a second grader sitting off to the side of our classroom for mandatory computer time. My task for the afternoon is to practice clicking and dragging an icon across the desktop of the classroom computer. This feels easy for me, who used to play educational games on my dad’s work laptop whenever he would let me. I hurry through it to go back to playing games.
I am a freshman at UVA. We are on break during a weekly two-hour seminar that the instructor fills with incessant lectures. I am on my back staring at the stars beginning to emerge in the evening sky. There has to be a better way to learn. I decide I want to teach.
I am an undergraduate who thinks they can handle a 9:00 AM class fresh out of high school. I miss class constantly.

What follows is material drawn from a larger book project I’m working on about an approach to digital humanities pedagogy that intersects with administrative policy to work towards a more equitable landscape for higher education. I’ll be blogging pieces of it as I go, so stay tuned for more related work in the future. Keep in mind, though, that I will likely be blogging about other topics intermittently as well. So I will tag the posts accordingly to make them easy to connect. Happy to hear feedback, either on social media or by email at bmw9t@virginia.edu.
===
“What is digital humanities?”
I was on my way to the annual meeting of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute when the customs officer posed the question to me. DH is a baggy and specialized academic field that suffers from as many competing definitions as it does detractors.  I have been asked to define the field more times than I count, but, standing in the immigration line at the Canadian border, I suddenly felt renewed urgency to get my terms straight. To describe my work with precision and clarity for a general audience. The officer ostensibly asked for an explanation, a narrative of my being in this place at this time, but he really just wanted facts. My actual response was unimportant. They just wanted to determine that I had a plausible reason for attending a conference they already knew was taking place (it was a small port of immigration and a large conference). There was a right and a wrong to the exchange. He wanted me to prove that I knew the proper response.
There was a pedagogy to the conversation, even though the officer might never have framed it as such. In Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire speaks at length of the banking model of education, the sense that typical educational practice sees students as operating at a deficit. The instructor, with their surplus of knowledge, deposits this valuable commodity in their pupils who are asked, in turn, to regurgitate learned facts at a later date. Power exists in the hands of the teacher, whose position of authority structures the economics of the classroom. Even though teaching and learning were far from the arm of the state I encountered at the Canadian border, a similar system of policies, power, and relationships structured our exchange. I was asked to participate in a quiz without being properly coached in the material, but the expected response was clear. “Show me you have the appropriate knowledge to show you are not a threat. Show that you have learned what it means to be a docile traveler,” the officer seemed to say, “and I will let you pass.” Freire’s central metaphor for this kind of encounter was economic: deposits, withdrawals, deficits, and surplus. But my encounter with customs showed that the same pedagogical apparatus operates in many walks of life. In this moment, I felt the pressure to teach this person something about digital humanities. To teach, in the face of an administrative official whose response to that instruction carried real stakes. To teach, while being confronted with an architecture that appeared to force my work to justify itself before knowing anything about it. Teach well, and I could continue to the conference. Teach poorly, and I would be subject to unknown bureaucratic hurdles. I only got so far as “Digital Humanities is…” before the official stamped my passport and let me through.
My encounter with Freire while traveling haunted me even once I returned to the University of Virginia and faced a different kind of border. It was the cusp of a new semester and the end of summer, so I took a few days to scout out the room I would be teaching in for the upcoming term. The space I found was a relic of an older era, before smart boards, inclusive design, or dynamic classrooms. With horror I found rows of old, wooden desks fastened to the ground with a series of bolts that prevented them from moving. The chairs produced an almost visceral response for students: they were physically uncomfortable, designed for normative bodies, and unyielding to whatever adjustments the user might need for their own work. I too had once sat in these very chairs during my undergraduate days at the same institution, and I remembered well the discomfort they caused. With an almost inexorable effect, the sense of being trapped led students to vandalize the chairs, and each chair was scrawled with the ink, carvings, and etchings of graffiti from decades of students. The chaotic, jubilant writings on each desk felt like an explicit act of rebellion against the physical space of the room and the desks themselves. Where the chairs spoke of quiet restraint, their surfaces told a different story, narrating favorite bands, quotations, weekend adventures, and more. Freedom. Flexibility. Movement. Waiting to get out of the chair.
A fresh-faced graduate instructor, I viewed these rows of desks from a perspective that was new to me: the front of the room. They might make sense for one kind of classroom, but I was puzzled as to how I would fit them to my needs for literary discussion. After all, they enforced a specific relationship between teacher and student by means of what Jesse Stommel has referred to as the “rhetoric of the room”—“the ways the shape of the room affects the learning we do inside of it.” The bolted chairs demanded the instructor take center stage, whether they wished to or not. While I had observed teachers carry out group work in those spaces, the physically restricted desks required students to turn sideways in their chairs in order to see one another. The room quite literally fought back against the pedagogy of the teacher and tried to enforce its own. Lecture; not discussion. Hierarchy; not democracy. As if aware of the tense dynamic between the instructor and the spaces given to them for teaching and learning, the students found themselves drawn back to carving their own frustrations into the furniture itself.
Still pondering these desks, I made my way over to the Scholars’ Lab, a center for digital research in the University Library where I had recently begun the first in a series of digital humanities fellowships that would lead to my present-day position as digital library professional. As was often the case, I plugged away on a group project with my fellowship cohort while sharing space with the librarians who taught us. I remember well the kinds of staff conversations we would overhear as we worked: endlessly supportive student mentoring, careful guidance in digital humanities project design, and the best instruction I had ever observed in my time as an educator. After one such meeting, as I expressed my frustrations with my role as a graduate instructor, one of these mentors floored me with their response: “I imagine that would be frustrating, but I don’t really teach.” This librarian was one of the best mentors I had ever had, and I regularly saw them shaping not just student research projects, but also providing expert guidance in how to shape a life doing this work.
How could someone so engaged in the act of teaching be so convinced that their work did not count? What was teaching, if not this? And who gets to make such determinations?
The immigration officer. The bolted desk. The university. They each regulate bodies, attitudes, and relationships. They share a crucial connection to my coworker in denial about their own teacherly identity. Our institutions carve out pedagogical relationships using spaces, policies, and actions while at the same time often rendering these dynamics invisible. As Stommel’s rhetoric of the room shows, spaces exert unexpected wills of their own, often over and above those of their inhabitants. But we can take his formulation one step further. The Canadian officer was acting in accordance with a long series of governmental policies enforcing social and legal procedures at the border. And rooms do not exist in isolation. The campus buildings at UVA contained many such rooms with bolted desks. Each of these roles and rooms was designed. Even though the UVA architect might not have thought of themselves as a teacher, their decisions actively shaped the experiences and pedagogies of those who do. Institutions of higher education are comprised of thousands of small decisions like these, innumerable small acts of pedagogy that affect teachers and learners—who we are allowed to be and who counts themselves as part of our number.

I’m in the middle of listening to an audiobook of David Byrne’s How Music Works. The book is a fascinating glimpse into the music industry, but I almost had to pull my car over when he started talking about digital humanities centers.
Okay–Byrne was actually in the middle of a whole chapter describing the special character of CBGB, the renowned music club that opened in 1973 and that was the frequent haunt of punk and new wave bands. But I was struck by just how resonant so much of his advice for cultivating a special and identifiable community was to me, someone who spends a lot of time working to do the same with students new to digital humanities. Once I parked, I quickly made some notes riffing on Byrne’s own eight characteristics of a successful music scene. I’ll share Byrne’s elements below and then riff on them as they relate to our own practice of cultivating collective DH experiences. You can find out more about Byrne’s own points by reading David A. Zimmerman’s summarizing blog post about the text.

There must be a venue that is of appropriate size and location in which to present material.
    
Space matters. It’s challenging to develop a sense of DH community without a space to gather, a place to house the energies of the group. One of the first tasks of a DH scene is often figuring out where it takes place. If physical space is not available to you—such locations are typically contested and hard won—take stock of other options. Virtual space, social media, community by mail, and more might be viable options, and they each offer their own affordances and limitations. And then make those spaces available to your people—as a student, it was impossible for me to reserve space. So friendly librarians who helped me do so meant the world to me.


The artists should be allowed to play their own material.
    
It’s not enough for community members to be passive contributors to the projects of others. They must be given the space and resources to allow their own creativity and their own original research projects to flourish. This also means making space for intentional play as a pathway to finding projects. Don’t ask people to show their DH project credentials at the door in order to get in!


Performing musicians must get in for free on their off nights (and maybe get free beer too)
    
Belonging should come cheap and often for those who want to join. In the Scholars’ Lab, we try to offer free tea and coffee to folks as often as possible. This might seem flippant, but it actually contributes in large ways to a sense of buy in with our group. Besides offering a ritual of belonging—we make this together for you—free coffee also offers a pathway into the Lab for those with economic hardship. Such resources are scarce for different communities, but it’s worth taking stock of what you can offer cheaply. What levers do you have?


There must be a sense of alienation from the prevailing music scene
    
For a DH scene to matter to someone, it has to stand for something. And that something typically stands in opposition to the larger institution around it. Look to your group’s larger context—what is left out? Who? How can your specific scene make space for those absences, center them, and give them a home? Discuss these values intentionally and find ways to act on them.


Rent must be low – and it must stay low
    
For Byrne, this was a larger commentary on the challenges of low-rent housing in a gentrifying area of New York City. For our own purposes, keep in mind that this work costs, but it should not cost the community. To keep your scene sustainable, it is worth regularly revisiting your prior assumptions about what is necessary to keep it flourishing. What might need to be sacrificed to maintain the ideological cohesion of your group? How does the changing financial landscape of your institution affect the underlying budgetary structures that make your work possible?


Bands must be paid fairly
    
Those who cultivate a DH scene have a responsibility to provide equitable compensation for the labor that its community members take on. Pay a living wage when possible. Advocate for better wages when it is not. Recognize and support labor organizing activities in the broader institution as you are able. Healthy labor practices ensure that your community knows you stand for and with them. They will notice.


Social transparency must be encouraged
    
Your community members make up your scene as much as the administrators who work in private to make it possible. Allow outside voices to help shape your practices—that’s how they become insiders. To cultivate the kind of DH scene your people want to see you need to ask them what they want. Ask what you can do for them—actions, events, speakers, and the like mean more when they come from community interest.


It must be possible to ignore the band when necessary
    
A flexible scene allows many smaller groups and communities to flourish. That is to say, a DH scene accommodates more than one use at one time. This is not to say smaller initiatives need be neglected. On the contrary—it allows your community to be agile, to flexibly act in many directions at once. Walk and chew gum at the same time. There are limitations to a group’s energies, of course, so be mindful of when you can ignore one aspect so as to safeguard energies for where you are needed.



I found, in particular, Byrne’s commentary on the intersections between spaces, policies, and creativity to be illuminating. Obviously there is much more to be said, and the analogy to Byrne’s music scene is not a 1:1 comparison. All communities have  limitations, and we cannot be all things to all people. But hopefully these quick notes riffing on Byrne are helpful as we all work to cultivate a sense of belonging and community in our own DH spaces. As you try to find your own scene.
Let’s jam.

I was always very quiet in coursework as a student. I have always had some measure of social anxiety, and I felt it especially acutely when pressured to participate in the service of a grade. This was a constant in every course I took except one: in graduate school I took a course with David Vander Meulen on textual editing, and I felt more engaged and free to do so than ever before or after. While David was an exceptional teacher, there were other specific reasons I credit with the vibe in the room: it was a three hour seminar and there were only four students in the room. I could not hide and, perhaps most importantly, in a group that small there was a real sense that we were in it together, that we were accountable to each other for keeping the conversation alive. The social anxiety persisted after the course, but I’ve always remembered that group dynamic fondly.
Did I mention the course met Friday mornings at 8:00AM? We really depended on each other to stay awake.
We’re trying a new thing this year in the Praxis program to bring something of this same spirit into the room, to encourage the students to feel more direct accountability for each other in discussion. In the past, whenever we’ve run unmoderated discussions I’ve generally facilitated them myself or in the company of a couple other Scholars’ Lab staff. Even when the students present their individual research projects for a design jam, a staff member serves as primary respondent and facilitator. This generally works fine, and the students are usually up for it. But the result is that the students are most accountable to the staff. This year I am going to experiment with rotating this role through the room a bit more, to spread the accountability around a bit more intentionally. For each session that will have discussion, I’ve assigned one or two students as primary facilitators. For sessions where a student will present, I’ve assigned another student as a respondent.
I’m trying not to overthink this too much: the real goal of this is to encourage collaboration, co-teaching, and collective buy-in in ways that might not take place if the students only feel accountable to the staff. But Jeremy wisely noted that not everyone might know how to facilitate a discussion. I come from the English department, where I’m used to teaching and learning based around open-ended conversation. But not every discipline is structured that way. Jeremy suggested I make a few notes about how I approach running discussions. What follows is my own starter pack for running a conversation. I have our own students in mind as the primary audience, but I imagine there is something useful here for others as well.

Questions not answers. This one comes from my literary studies background. I tend to see my role as a discussion facilitator as primarily about opening rather than closing, about shaping doors and inviting the group through. They can choose to enter or not, as distinct from other approaches to teaching that might pull the group along in a specific direction. When I write lesson plans they are almost always lists of questions to ask. Note that this is different from a project meeting, which has a specific goal and purpose! More on that in a different post.
Other shapes. I am not the sole giver of knowledge in the room. Instead of an arrow that I carve into the ground, what other shapes can the group draw together? How can we design our own ways of building knowledge together? Everyone has something to contribute, and I am there to learn as much as everyone else. The experience is not unidirectional. It twists, turns, folds back.
Give space. More than you think. I like to count silently to make room for others. When in doubt, sit quietly. Thinking is hard work, and hard work takes time. Don’t mistake silence for confusion or lack of engagement. Your silence can be a gift.
Be mindful. Who has spoken a lot? Who has not? How can you enlist the aid of the sturdy talkers in making room for others? How can you draw in the quiet ones? Pay attention to where you’re going as well as where you’ve been. Don’t think of yourself as yanking the group towards an end goal. Can you point the way and then follow? Can you help draw connections among various things that have already been said? At the end, can you sum up where you’ve gone together? I often like to drawn on the board to visually represent the flow of our conversation.

It should be clear from all this that my approach is as much about community building as an end in itself as it is about the actual material. That is to say—I like my students and my discussions to live out a specific kind of learning experience together using the material as a vehicle. We discuss the material too-quite deeply-but the particular manner in which we do so is as important to the learning goals as any particular message about the specific topic of conversation. When Jeremy asked me to write this post I immediately wanted to turn the question back around. How does he run a discussion, coming from history? How does Ronda’s own background as a life coach and project manager change her angle of approach? Everyone brings their own selves to running the classroom, and I think there is beauty in this diverse range of teacherly identities. I would love to hear how others take on this role and how they approach the difficult task of developing group identity, making space for other voices, and building up a collective teaching experience.

The following contains my lightly edited contribution to the ADHO2024 session entitled “Missions Accomplished? The Future of Mission-Driven Digital Scholarship Journals in DH.” The panel had representatives from several different digital humanities journals talking about ideological underpinnings for their publications.

Hello! My name is Brandon Walsh, and I’m the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab in the University of Virginia Library.

It’s wonderful to be with you today to talk about the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy, a publication based out of CUNY that I have had the pleasure of working on for several years now. We are “A journal promoting open scholarly discourse around critical and creative uses of technology in teaching, learning, and research.”

My initial pitch for this group was to talk about the journal as doing more than just writing about teaching and learning: we also build pedagogy into our publishing process and infrastructure. But as I was researching for this talk I actually found that some of my colleagues on the journal’s editorial collective have already made that argument, so I wanted to first and foremost point you to their publication entitled “Who Guards the Gates? Feminist Methods of Scholarly Publishing” by Laura Wildemann Kane, Amanda Licastro, and Danica Savonick. They do a better job of articulating what I was hoping to discuss than I could, and I’d encourage you to go there first. In my brief time here I’ll just give the cliffs notes version of their work and try to build upon it. Laura, Amanda, and Danica discuss JITP in the following terms—as  model for feminist modes of collaboration and inclusivity:

Publishing timeline - the journal publishes twice a year, usually alternating a general issue with a themed issue. This extraordinarily rapid timeline has students and early-career scholars on the job market in mind - those in need of a publication on their CV don’t have the luxury of waiting years for more traditional venues. 
EC student quota - the journal has written into its governance structure that the collective be between 21 and 25 active members and roughly half of those members should be students. The journal’s managing editor is also a student whose full-time gig with the journal offers him membership in CUNY’s union.
Variety of publication genres- in addition to the twice-a-year issues that share long-form essays, we publish, on a rolling basis, a variety of “short forms” that expand the kinds of work we share: assignments, teaching fails, blueprints, and book reviews. This makes it possible for students to find a range of ways to represent their work professionally.
The article has lots more in it—lots of great data, history, and argument about the journal and what it means for students on the EC. It’s a space to learn about all parts of the publishing process, from editorial skills to technical web publishing literacies to inclusive and equitable publication practices.

All of this means that the infrastructure of the journal has teaching and professional development in its bones. We’re not just publishing the work of teaching: we’re baking it into the dough. Our plumbing is pedagogy. We’re not just a venue: we’re a means by which the professional development of young scholars is the core activity of the journal, where members of a scholarly unit can grow. In this way, I see our work as a natural evolution of what Matthew Gold, Katharine Harris, Rebecca Frost Davis, and Jenterey Sayers  have called for under the #citepedagogy movement, which is the idea that we need to cite teaching materials and syllabi as scholarly work in their own right to make them part of the scholarly record. In short, teaching is not the thing that distracts from research output. It’s a part of it. But JITP shows that our publishing infrastructure itself can be built and rebuilt with students at the core. In short, it’s not enough to publish pedagogy. We can work towards pedagogical publication, a publishing infrastructure that cares about the needs of students and early career folks first and foremost.

Again, please check out Laura, Amanda, and Danica’s work on this. In preparing for this talk, Amanda Licastro and I actually realized we were both presenting on related topics. Amanda will be doing a follow-up presentation at MLA this year about JITP and professional development so stay tuned for that one. We recently zoomed to discuss the overlap between this talk and her upcoming one, so I want to further give her credit for my thinking on this—I’ll mention her a lot in what’s to come and I think she’s here. I want to focus on one thing in particular—the makeup of the board.

To reiterate: the editorial collective is mandated to have a certain number of student voices on it. Every time we put a call out we specify that a certain number of those selected will be students. This is fantastic - it makes it so much easier to address feelings of imposterdom with students that I’m trying to recruit because I can say “no you are exactly qualified in so many ways. We are looking for people just like you!” It means that student experience, opinion, and vision is always centered on the collective. But there are also other ways in which this makeup causes significant challenges. The thing about students is they will eventually, one way or another, no longer be students. If all goes well they will graduate and move on to better things. This sort of turnover is a sustainability problem faced by all projects and all journals—but it’s especially salient for us because even if people stay they no longer count as students. The journal’s greatest triumph is if we provide a vehicle for professional development such that our students no longer count as such. This means that a healthy editorial collective oriented in this way will constantly refresh itself with new ideas and new persons on the board. It also means, of course, that there is a constant churn—always new folks to mentor, new visions to weigh. But this is the only way to continue to keep student needs in mind. What it even means to be a student is constantly changing. Students are not the same now as they were before COVID, as they were a decade ago when I was a student. Two decades ago. Three. Every year my own memory of what it meant to be a student living paycheck to paycheck recedes into the rearview mirror and it also, either way, bears only a tenuous relationship to current student experience. We need actual student representation in order to maintain that point of view.

To ground a publishing process in student needs and experiences might be an attempt to castles made of sand, to found our publishing practices on ideological and ethical grounds that must change, by design. I’m put in mind of Jesse Mitchell’s description of inclusive design as like bathing—you’ve gotta keep doing it. Orienting a publishing process around teaching, pedagogy, professional development is an ongoing, never ending challenge. A living wage today might be untenable tomorrow. What counts as meaningful professional development for one student might not parse for another. In this way, the instability that our student focus brings is perhaps a strength. You’ve got to keep bathing. If you want to do good, equitable and ethical student-centered work you have to keep re-evaluating your priors and how you think things need to be done.
Something I’ve been thinking a lot about: what do older hands bring to publishing pipelines that model themselves on newer voices? In a journal centered around the changing needs of students, what is the role of the non-student editor? What are our responsibilities? For one, we bring memory. The ability of the institution to remember its own history is always challenged by the fact that those with the memories are likely to move on. Amanda likened it, astutely, to the efforts by Cheryl Ball and Douglas Eyman to chronicle the history of Kairos. Simply remembering is labor in its own right. I wonder how much pedagogy publishing is itself an attempt to solidify and preserve the ephemeral acts in the classroom.
 There is also, of course, a certain amount of social and administrative capital that the more experienced editorial publisher can offer. A lot of what Amanda and I see our work on the collective as is to signal boost - to use our network to promote and extend the reach of the journal in a way that a graduate student might struggle with. Those networks just take time to build. I also try, at virtually every event I attend, to plug the journal and offer to people the opportunity to talk about our publishing process, how to submit, and offer feedback they might have potential article ideas. I extend this to you here and now as well! It’s a way to try to pay forward the good luck and mentoring that I have received.
In addition, Amanda works on the governance and oversight committee and had wonderful thoughts on her own relationship to that work. I love that our journal models itself on asking students to act in public as professionals and contributors to the scholarly conversation. But that process is not always smooth. It can be asking a lot for students, with little to no job security, to shoulder the weight of tense moments of internal or external conflict. It can be the responsibility of more established scholars to help shape a space for radical professional development and mentoring by doing but in a way that helps to mitigate the risks of acting as professionals in public in this way.
To put a button on these things—JITP is a model, I think, for how to build a publishing process that, in form and function, centers student pedagogy. It’s not enough to publish pedagogy or to cite it. Our scholarly structures need to be built and rebuilt with student voices, experiences, and needs in mind. This process is challenging, tenuous, and always in process. For those of us lucky enough to still be here, to be in full-time positions, it’s on us to help the students of today meet the challenges of this work. To help make space for students. To hold the bucket and shovel and dig in. Thanks!

Applications are now open for Praxis Fellowships to be held during the 2025-2026 academic year. Further details below about this application cycle, which has applications due November 1st, 2024. Consider spending time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2025-2026 cohort - Monday, September 9th, 2024 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities, offered by the UVa Library’s Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students each year as they explore various aspects of digital humanities together. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, and share a range of digital humanities activities over the course of the year. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to equip fellows with the skills necessary for future research, teaching, and administration within digital humanities.
Praxis training takes a variety of shapes meant to reflect the full-range of DH work.  As a part of their training with us, student cohorts regularly publish a range of values statements describing the intentional communities they want to build together. They also design and teach digital humanities workshops based on their own interests as a means to exercise minimalist pedagogical approaches to DH. Students design speculative projects and events that might go on to be implemented by the Lab. They also participate in a range of technical and design activities meant to reflect the range of digital practices they will encounter in their research. At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named projects. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the portfolio requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities and supplements the curricular work undertaken in that program.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. 
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we can certainly accommodate travel needs).
Students will often be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held, as the fellowship typically serves as a teaching replacement in the amount of $12,607 over the course of the year. Students rising into the fifth year of their support package who would ordinarily not have teaching obligations will be able to defer two semesters of teaching relief such that they will not have teaching requirements in their sixth year. They have the alternate option of leaving the structure of their current support package intact and instead receiving the fellowship as an external award up to 130% of their typical PhD fellowship amount as per GSAS policy. Students outside of GSAS or with other concerns should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility given their particular cirumstances.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from a committee about your application. To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiousity can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Monday, 12/2 from 10-12; or Tuesday, 12/3 from 1-3 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview);
Anything else we should know? - pronouns, a name you go by other than the one on your email, any other experiences or backgrounds you want to make sure we are aware of, or anything else you would like to share.

In addition, we ask for a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that the application can affect teaching rosters).
The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program. We recommend applicants start by reading our charter and a blog post on “Questions to ask When Applying.”
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due November 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

One of my earliest teaching memories was of too much. I had gotten an example syllabus to consult as I prepared to teach my own course for the first time, and I remember being floored by so many policies, most of them required by my institution. Did my first learning encounter with the students have to be structured exclusively by rules? By so many pages of them? How was I supposed to find my way as a teacher–just one person–among so much?
By contrast, less has paid dividends so often in my teaching career. Fewer readings, more conversation. Less technology, more time to develop literacy. Smaller scale, closer attention to the students in front of me. For me, thinking small always leads to impact–and a more sustainable classroom. Danica Savonick has a wonderful summary of her particular take on minimalist digital humanities pedagogy over on JITP. For her, minimalist DH pedagogy is a set of “strategies for teaching DH at institutions that don’t have many resources for doing so” by favoring free or low-cost tools. We could bring together a cluster of related ideas to extend this conversation. Paul Fyfe on digital pedagogy unplugged or Jentery Sayers on low-tech approaches to digital research as a way to center the underlying conversations behind the technology. Fyfe again on mid-sized digital pedagogy as a way to think about teaching through the continuum of what scale can be. John E. Russell and Merinda Kaye Hensley on buttonology as a way of thinking about teaching that over-emphasizes interfaces at the expense of critical thinking. For me, a minimalist approach to teaching digital humanities can be thought of as a generalized approach to the work that we do, a pursuit of the best possible teaching by creatively working at, across, and despite resource limitations. The pursuit of less is often the pursuit of reality, an attempt to match my teaching to my own lived experiences as well as to that of my students. A way of seeking safety for us to grow together. A healthy jog instead of a sprint. In most cases, this pursuit of healthy scale can feel impossible given the day-to-day circumstances of working in higher education.
More on the merits of minimalism in a future post though. For now, I want to write a bit about a related problem that I’ve been pondering as I try to theorize about minimalist DH teaching. What are these approaches writing against? How much of this is explicit and how much might be unexamined in DH teaching? How might more illuminate what we mean when we intentionally aim for less?
How would we characterize a maximalist approach to digital humanities pedagogy?
Marília Matoso has a succint summary of maximalism as a design aesthetic on ArchDaily. Maximalism is an approach that favors more. Organized excess, divergent patterns, and conflicting personalities: “it celebrates imprecision, embraces diversity, blurs the lines between reality and fantasy, encourages spontaneity, and champions freedom of expression.” Maximalism is a lot, and that’s by design. Here’s a photo from unsplash user Steph Wilson tagged as maximalist.

I’ve been able to find only very few people writing about maximalism in the context of education (if you have other sources let me know!). Paul Emerich France theorizes maximalism in the classroom in negative terms as an approach that stuffs more in wherever possible–more activities, more topics, more attention–in a way that is unsustainable. Richard Paul uses the terms differently: minimalist approaches to teaching focus on the educational environment itself–what do you need to learn to pass a test–while maximalist pedagogy is concerned with the transfer of academic lessons to the broader world. By Paul’s own admission, though, maximalist goals are something of an ideal to aspire to, as instructors are limited by the infrastructure they possess to support their work: “It’s not fair to expect a center to accomplish maximalist ends with a minimalist budget” (126).
My knee-jerk theorization of a maximalist approach to DH teaching is a starkly negative one: I’ve seen too much pain from unsustainable approaches to teaching and practicing DH. Resource scarcity is, I would wager, far more the rule than the exception in education. Whether it is the time-pressed and overworked instructor at a teaching-intensive institution, the under-resourced and over-tired K-12 educator, or the over-stretched digital humanities campus coordinator–rarely do we have enough, let alone space for more. Teachers in these contexts find themselves tossed between kinds of teaching–what they are required to do and what they would aspire to do–doing their best to survive while more is always in the offing.
I need to do more thinking, and I’ll doubtless put a caveat on this post in the future as I do so. But as of right now, my take might be summed up as this: maximalist digital humanities pedagogy is an approach to DH teaching and learning that aims for more as a virtue in itself. To be clear: I believe this approach is often unexamined, as someone new to teaching DH might default to this approach out of insecurity: “in order for a course to feel DH enough, students must do X, Y, and Z.” Teachers in this position don’t necessarily intend to adopt this pedagogical approach. After all, teaching towards less takes discipline. Rest requires restraint.
Put more bluntly, maximalist digital humanities pedagogy often operates without consideration of the costs, limits, or wisdom of scale. More often, I would wager, teachers are forced into this pedagogical position by forces outside their control. We might say, then, that institutions, administrators, or collaborators who ask more of their teaching staff are operating with a maximalist approach to pedagogy whether they realize it or not. As a result, the instructors–already in a position of scarcity–are forced to maximize as they are caught between these forces and their students. So, we might update our definition to say that a maximalist digital humanities pedagogy might be a function of circumstance, an institutional context, as much as a teacherly approach. We would do less if we could, but the operational pedagogy of the institution around us is towards more.
As I keep working on the topic I’ll want to think more about how to nuance this theory. In particular, my readings on design maximalism brought out many positive characteristics: joy, abundance, diverse points of view, democracy, acceptance, and more. How might we square these with our working definition of maximalist digital humanities pedagogy, one that must operate within the limits of our classrooms, our institutions, our lives? Can maximalist teaching be a good thing?
I could keep going. But, after all, this is meant to be a blog post in the direction of a future longer piece–not the longer project itself. Let me take this as a chance to do less. For now, I will close with a series of provocations that, to me, ring of a maximalist digital humanities pedagogy as I currently understand it. Think of these in the spirit of the Cult of Done Manifesto. The following messy, impartial list is meant to elicit reflection and pause. Think of it as a list of things that, when I see them, make me raise an eyebrow and wonder if maximalism DH pedagogy has snuck into the room. They make me wonder if we shouldn’t take a pause.
A Maximalist Digital Humanities Pedagogy is characterized by…

Many tools; few decisions
Dwelling only in possibilities
No constraints
More readings
Many project partners
The latest
Many assignments
The greatest
Breathlessness
Tech, tech, tech
No prior experience necessary; breakneck speed assumed
Overwhelm
MOOCs1
Overwork
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow
No clocks
Many on the one
Bursting circles
No deadlines
Two in one
Syllabus creep
Yes, and2
“How do we scale this up?”
Much
Up
Fast
Full




Hat tip to Fyfe’s mid-range pedagogy. ↩


This recalls Lisa Rhody’s fantastic piece on improv comedy and digital humanities, which points to the phrase as the foundation of generous collaboration. I wholeheartedly agree, but I need to think further in order to reconcile this with my own thinking above. Perhaps, one should ask “should we?” before we yes, and? ↩

My family moved house this winter, so I spent countless hours packing, unpacking, setting up, and driving. Audiobooks were a great companion for all that work. Here are the four relevant to DH and teaching that I got through in the past several weeks.

Ratchetdemic: Reimagining Academic Success by Christopher Emdin. I adored this text that was recommended to me by Seanna Viechweg, one of our brilliant Praxis students this year. In it, Emdin advocates for bringing the authentic, lived experience of teachers and students into the classroom, especially when their identities depart from what might be considered academically acceptable. Emdin writes explicitly from his experiences teaching in urban classrooms, where he saw the conflict between teacherly norms that value whiteness and devalue disruptive, lived, or “ratchet” behaviors. The ratchetdemic bridges these divides by making the ratchet a tool of political and pedagogical protest.
Fugitive Pedagogy: Carter G. Woodson and the Art of Black Teaching by Jarvis R. Givens. I went straight from Ratchetdemic to Fugitive Pedagogy, in part because some of the reviews for Emdin’s work put his work in dialogue with Woodson. Fugitive Pedagogy is both a history of Woodson’s innovative leadership in Black education as well as the articulation of a concept that Givens sees as central to that work. Fugitive pedagogy as a pedagogical theory refers to the ways in which Black education has always seen teaching and learning as acts of rebellion, from literacy as a path to freedom for emancipated peoples to the careful ways in which Black teachers navigated the hostile pressure from white administrators while attempting to teach in the Jim Crow era.
Feed by M.T. Anderson. I’ve long been kicking around the idea of an introductory literature course on the novel in the age of the Internet. Feed was recommended to me by my wife, who did her dissertation on Victorian teen culture and knows more about young-adult fiction than I will ever forget. Feed is a dystopian text where a majority of American citizens have an internet feed implanted in their brains that gives a steady stream of chat, marketing, and statistical data. My spouse and I talked a lot about how much different this text must have read in 2002, when it came out, as opposed to the present day.
The Professor is In: The Essential Guide to Turning Your PhD into a Job by Karen Kelsky. I’ve been familiar with Kelsky’s work for some time, more by reputation than for any specifics. In a recent conversation about professional development, a student referenced The Professor is In in such a way that made me feel I couldn’t avoid reading it any longer. The book outlines an extremely detailed path through the academic job market, in all of its toxic, challenging, and unfair shapes. While I might disagree with some of the specific recommendations, the overall message of the book–that advisors have an ethical obligation to prepare students for what comes after the PhD–is an important one. And I think it’s vital reading for anyone in a position to advise students, if for no other reason to be literate in the conversation.

As part of the final unit in the Praxis curriculum each fall our students extensively discuss teaching and learning in digital humanities. As a way of putting these conversations into practice, they develop two outcomes: a speculative, minimal DH workshop related to their research and a teaching philosophy statement related to their newfound interests in digital pedagogy. It’s been years since I’ve put together a formal teaching statement (unless you count the various student charters on the Scholars’ Lab website), so I had planned on joining the students in their writing process and producing a statement of my own to share with them. Things got away from me, though, as my wife and I just moved and are also preparing for our first baby. I didn’t have the mental wherewithal to devote to this task, but I thought I’d spin up something quickly in the same spirit.
I’m sharing this post as a creative spin on the genre: my teaching statement in thirteen images (thirteen because that’s the Praxis cohort we’re currently running). Consider it a visual collage of how I approach working with students in and out of the classroom. I used unsplash, a great source for open and free images, to search for keywords that were meaningful to my digital pedagogy. I won’t explain them beyond describing the pictures in alt-text. Instead, I think they’re useful to meditate on for yourself. When you teach, what do you see?

I’m going to start documenting the reading I’m doing on the blog here for a couple reasons. First, it will motivate me to keep at it! Second, it will give me some quick summary notes to look back on. I’m doing most of my reading these days by way of audiobooks, so it feels especially important to find some way of keeping what I’ve been exploring in my head. Hopefully this little public journal will do the trick! Here are some things I’ve been checking out lately, all available as audiobooks.


The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power by Shoshana Zuboff. There are a range of useful terms here: instrumentarian, big other, shadow text, behavioral surplus, and more. They all cricle around the titular term, which refer to the new economic systems pioneered by technology companies that profit on the use of private data, data which enables those companies to further target consumers more precisely and efficiently in a kind of feedback loop.


Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code by Ruha Benjamin. This is an essential text for anyone interested broadly in how race intersects with technology. The “New Jim Code” is a useful takeaway term, and Wikipedia has good summary definition: “In it, Benjamin develops her concept of the “New Jim Code,” which references Michelle Alexander’s work The New Jim Crow, to analyze how seemingly ‘neutral’ algorithms and applications can replicate or worsen racial bias.”


Geeky Pedagogy: A Guide for Intellectuals, Introverts, and Nerds Who Want to Be Effective Teachers by Jessamyn Neuhaus. The main takeaway I got from this text was that sometimes new teachers assume that their passion for their subject matter will make them effective in the classroom. But this enthusiasm is not enough. Instead, Neuhaus offers a range of reflections to help new teachers from a broad range of categories–Intellectuals, Introverts, Nerds, Geeks–more effectively and inclusively reach a range of student audiences.


Write No Matter What: Advice for Academics by Joli Jensen. This book contains a range of strategies and tactics for fitting writing into the cracks of the academic day. While I disagree with the way the book treats labor within academic structures–really no matter what?–I did find some helpful approaches to developing process-oriented methods for getting writing done.


That’s all for now! More next time.

If you’ve spent any time at all reading on my blog you’ve probably noticed that I crosspost virtually all my material to the Scholars’ Lab site. There are good reasons for this: almost everything I do in one space is relevant to the other, and it’s way to drive traffic between the two places. It’s a bit of a pain though. While both sites are built with Jekyll, they live in two different repositories, two different folders on my computer. They also each have slightly different frontmatter. So my old workflow looked something like this:

Compose and edit in my blog repository.
Open a second window.
Carefully copy and past everything from my original post into the identical post in the other site folder.
Edit the front matter.
Publish.
Grumble the whole time.

I use a rake task to automate the building of the initial post, which saves a little time by generating everything for my post templates.
That command looks like this:
desc "Begin a new post in #{posts_dir}"
task :new_post, :title do |t, args|
  if args.title
    title = args.title
  end
  clean_title = title.downcase.gsub(/\s/,'-')
  title_slug =clean_title.downcase.gsub(' ', '-').gsub(/[^\w-]/, '')
  filename = "#{posts_dir}/#{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}-#{clean_title}.#{new_post_ext}"
  if File.exist?(filename)
    abort("rake aborted!") if ask("#{filename} already exists. Do you want to overwrite?", ['y', 'n']) == 'n'
  end
  puts "Creating new post: #{filename}"
  open(filename, 'w') do |post|
    post.puts "---"
    post.puts "layout: post"
    post.puts "title: \"#{title.gsub(/&/,'&amp;')}\""
    post.puts "date: #{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}"
    post.puts "
tags: [digital-humanities]"
    post.puts "crosspost:
  - title: #{crosspost_title}
    url: #{crosspost_url}#{title_slug}"
    post.puts "---"
  end
end

A lot of the core code here was adapted from Octopress, a blogging framework I haven’t used per se in several years. There are some useful rake tasks that have persisted as my blog changed though. There’s a lot of Ruby above, but the upshot is that, when I go to blog, I give a command in this form from the terminal:

$ rake new_post["Flashy title here"]

The rake task will create a new post in my _drafts folder with 2023-10-23-flashy-title-here.md that looks like this:
---
layout: post
title: "Flashy title here"
date: 2023-10-23tags: [digital-humanities]
crosspost:
  - title: the Scholars' Lab blog
    url: https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/flasy-title-here
---


I’ll then fill in the content of the post below the triple dashes. After years of manually crossposting things, I decided to make another rake task that would mirror this one, a terminal command that I could run from my blog folder like so:

$ rake crosspost['2023-10-23-flashy-title-here.md','True']

This command would copy my completed post file to the other project folder for the Scholars’ Lab site, spin up the necessary metadata, and copy over any images that are necessary for the post.
Here’s what that rake command looks like:
desc "Makes a crossposted file in the slab folder"
task :crosspost, [:file_name, :images] do |t, args|
  if args.file_name
    file_name = args.file_name
  end
  puts file_name
  old_file = "_posts/#{file_name}"
  new_file = "#{slab_dir}/#{file_name}"
  puts new_file

  parsed = FrontMatterParser::Parser.parse_file(old_file, loader: FrontMatterParser::Loader::Yaml.new(allowlist_classes: [Date]))

  title_slug = parsed.front_matter['title'].downcase.gsub(' ', '-').gsub(/[^\w-]/, '')
  if File.exists?(new_file)
    File.delete(new_file)
  end
  File.open(new_file, 'w'){|f|
f.puts("---
author: brandon-walsh
date: #{parsed.front_matter['date']}
layout: post
slug: #{title_slug}
title: #{parsed.front_matter['title']}
category:
crosspost:
  - title: #{blog_title}
    url: #{blog_url}/#{title_slug}
---
#{parsed.content}
")
}
    puts "Crossposted file created at #{new_file}"
  post_image_folder = blog_image_dir + '/' + title_slug
  crosspost_image_folder = slab_image_dir  + '/' + title_slug
if args.images
  if File.exists?(crosspost_image_folder)
    FileUtils.rm_rf(crosspost_image_folder)
    Dir.mkdir(crosspost_image_folder) 
  end
  FileUtils.cp_r(post_image_folder + '/.', crosspost_image_folder)
end
end

This lets me pass the name of the post file and whether or not it contains images to a new crosspost rake task, which will then handle everything else for me. Now my workflow is much more streamlined. If you’re interested in setting this for on your crossposting needs, you can follow these steps.
Assumptions:

File structure
    
You have two jekyll blogging folders on your computer.
Each of these blogging folders has a regularized system for image handling, where you store the images for your post in project-folder/assets/sluggified-name-of-post
I’ve included at the top of the Rakefile a series of variables that you can update for the particulars of your file structure


Each blog post has the crossposting code as a part of _layouts/post.html
You will update the Rakefile to account for your own metadata, as well as any differences between metadata in the two blogs.

To implement on your own, then, do the following:

Create a Rakefile in the root of your main jekyll blog folder.
Paste into it the contents of this Rakefile
You’ll need to install one gem - front_matter_parser - by running this command from your main blogging folder: $ gem install front_matter_parser
In each Jekyll blog folder, add the following code to your post layout to actually use the crossposting metadata. Both folders have this in their _layouts/post.html file:

{% if page.crosspost %}
<div class="post_crosspost">
    {% if page.crosspost.size == 1 %}
    Crossposted to <a href="{{ page.crosspost[0].url }}">{{ page.crosspost[0].title }}</a>.
    {% else %}
  {% capture crosspostings %}
  {% for target in page.crosspost %}
  <a href="{{ target.url }}">{{ target.title }}</a>,
  {% endfor %}
  {% endcapture %}
  {% assign crosspostarray = crosspostings | strip | split: "," %}
  Crossposted to {{ crosspostarray | array_to_sentence_string }}.
  {% endif %}
  <br><br>
</div>
{% endif %}

Now you should be able to do something like the following as your workflow.

Make my new post: $ rake new_post["Title of Blog post"]
Draft and finalize post
Crosspost it by passing a filename and True if there are images to crosspost: $ rake crosspost["year-month-day-sluggified-title.md","True"]

Hope that helps! I tried to abstract things so that this could be usable by others with slightly different setups than mine, but let me know if you try to use it and run into problems.

Applications are now open for the 2024-2025 Digital Humanities Fellowship cohort. The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2024-2025 academic year is February 15th, 2024. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2024-2025 cohort - Monday, January 15th, 2024 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, encouraged to write for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can begin your application.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,480 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,480 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with the Lab and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The student’s Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student’s application.
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue (no more than two pages);
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that holding the fellowship can affect teaching rosters);
and your availability for a 30-minute interview slot during the following times: Monday, February 26 from 2:00-3:30 or Wednesday, February 28th from 10:00-11:30. This should be communicated in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together.
During the 2024-2025 cycle, Brandon will be on leave starting January 15th, 2024. Applicants with questions about Grad Fellowships, the application process, or their eligibility are encouraged to write soon for clarification. After January 15th, correspondence regarding DH project proposals can be directed to Ronda Grizzle.

We’re in the thick of our unit on teaching and learning in Praxis, where students discuss a range of teaching topics including buttonology, minimalist pedagogy, and critical digital pedagogy. As outcomes for the conversation we ask the students to produce two things:

a minimalist, speculative digital humanities workshop on a topic of interest to them as a teach-to-learn activity
a teaching statement that might intersect with their new thinking on digital pedagogy

The context for the two assignments is that all DH involves teaching at some level. Graduate students rarely receive adequate training in teaching, and they often teach under very specific departmental constraints. The two activities are meant to give them experience thinking about a range of teaching possibilities that they might not otherwise get to experience. I would wager further that most departments don’t offer much training in writing about teaching, either in formalized teaching statements or otherwise. Ashley Hosbach-Wallman, UVA’s Education and Social Research Librarian, gives our students a wonderful introduction to writing about teaching. I pair Ashley’s workshop with a free-writing activity to help the students move past fears they might have about writing correctly on the topic. The only way to begin is by beginning, after all.1 I couldn’t actually be there in person to run this activity for the students, so I’m sharing these slides and the context for them in the hopes that they will run it at home.
Free Writing About Pedagogy
The spirit of this activity is heavily inspired by a workshop that Sean Michael Morris ran at Digital Pedagogy Lab on writing about teaching. All the good here comes from Sean - I merely adapted it for my own particular context. The gist is that the activity gives students a topic, a set amount of time to free write on it, and some rules to guide the process. The rules Sean gave for that writing process are mostly about self-criticism:

Don’t judge what you write.
Feel free to use first person.
Keep writing.
Be honest. Don’t write for someone else.

Keep writing, and don’t let your own internal voice get in the way of putting words down on the page. With those guidelines in mind, students move through a set of curated topics you give them. As facilitator, my job is mostly to encourage them to use the whole time saying things like “if you think you’re done keep going because you’ll go somewhere unexpected.” Mostly I just watch the timer. The activity is quite flexible and can be adapted to any circumstance: just change the prompts. In my experience, graduate students find it quite transformative and request the workshop a second time later in the year. The first time I ran it one of the students exclaimed, “I wrote 2000 words in an hour! My dissertation feels like it will be no problem!” For students accustomed to working towards perfection, free writing offers a radical reorientation towards what the writing process can feel like.
I start the workshop with a slide of my cat on a piece of paper just because I can. I usually offer some point of entry to the effect of…Pepper loves boxes. But they can also be scary? And what can make you feel more boxed in than a blank sheet of paper? Here is Pepper surrounded by frightening sheets. Free writing can help us get past the fear of the page and just put words down. But this has also just been an excuse to share photos of my beloved cat.

Moving on to the first free writing exercise. At this point in the curriculum, our students have done a mind mapping exercise that encourages them to free associate different linked concepts related to teaching and learning. I haven’t written up that actvity just yet (I will!), but you can find the slide deck on the Praxis site if you wanted to run it on your own. To get started with our free writing:
What are the most important values that you bring to teaching? To digital pedagogy? Write for eight minutes on this.

When designing your speculative DH workshop, how might you craft it in such a way that it reflects the values you just wrote about? How will you teach digital methods in a way that honors the things you care about? Write for eight minutes.

What activity are you planning for your workshop? What are the actual nuts and bolts of what you might do in the room? If you’re struggling to come up with an idea for the workshop, how might you explain the concept you’re interested in to a third grader? Write for eight minutes.

What sorts of anxieties do you have about teaching and learning? What fears do you have about digital pedagogy? What sort of things can you do to mitigate those concerns? Eight minutes again.

I usually close the workshop with another photo of Pepper. Now, having written, he is happily asleep and at peace. He’s moved past the box.

And that’s it! The activity is very flexible–add topics or take them away. Add time or subtract depending on the amount of time you have. Run the activities for yourself or others. If this approach to writing feels completely anathema to the way you work, you might find yourself pushed in new directions. If this all feels familiar, maybe the slides will help give you more material for what you’re already doing. I’m really grateful to Sean for the workshop that got me going in this direction. His workshop on writing about teaching really taught me a lot about both.



Ashley’s workshop also incorporates free writing as well! She does a great job linking formal and informal ways of writing about teaching. ↩

Praxis is in the middle of our unit on digital humanities teaching and learning. As a part of this section of the year, our students’ task is to design a lightweight, speculative workshop that introduces a DH concept of interest to them. The activity is a teach-to-learn one with some constraints: in an effort to move beyond buttonology approaches to teaching technical topics, the students are meant to think through how pencil and paper, low-tech, or otherwise minimal ways of teaching might empower themselves and their students to learn material that might otherwise feel beyond them.
At this point in the semester the fellows have just begun their thinking. I asked them to run an activity related to Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities as a means of finding the areas within digital pedagogy that speak to them. And then from there we did some mind mapping work meant to encourage the students to think broadly about how teaching intersected with their interests in the field. So the fellows all have a general sense of what their workshop topic will be but no specifics just yet. Yesterday when discussing their ideas, a number of the students expressed difficulty moving from these large topics to actual, teachable activities. How do you get from a focus on network analysis to an activity using string and rope? Do you just wait for inspiration to strike?
I’ll be sharing a few posts in the coming weeks with exercises that our current fellows might use to help facilitate the brainstorming process. In this first piece, I’ll touch on ways to bring iterative design into the development of lesson plans to open them up as spaces of possibility. I’ll call it “One Concept: Ten Ways to Teach.”
One Concept: Ten Ways to Teach
I would wager when most people lesson plan that they try to do so as quickly as possible. Working under the constraints of limited time and resources, we probably take the first or second good idea that we have for approaching our material. Rarely do we dwell in the possibilities that the learning experience might contain, but a quick speculative exercise can help us do so when we have the luxury of more time to think. If we iteratively take on several different approaches with intentional constraints we can explore the myriad ways we might approach teaching a particular topic.
The title and approach here shamelessly adapt (rip off) Wired’s 5 Levels series. In the 5 Levels videos, an expert teaches a single concept to five different audiences and with varying levels of complexity: “first to a child, then a teenager, then an undergrad majoring in the same subject, a grad student and, finally, a colleague.” In the video I’m most familiar with, music phenom Jacob Collier explains the definition of harmony to a child (harmony makes a melody less lonely and helps us change how it feels) all the way to jazz legend Herbie Hancock (what even is harmony anyway?).
The series orients itself around a kind of idealistic approach to teaching and learning: a complex idea can explained to anyone given the right approach. While that is a useful lesson in itself, the approach can also be used as a generative exercise in iterative design. Forcing ourselves to explain the same concept with varying levels of complexity and constraints can help us push past our usual teaching models. Here’s how we might apply it to a DH context.
Take one minute to think of the DH topic or method you want to focus on. Write it down.
You’ll now practice different ways of teaching the same idea. For each one, take one to two minutes to think and then three minutes to write before moving on to the next one. In each case, it is probably more important to capture the general approach you would take than to focus on writing an actual, new explanation. For each new way, consider these questions:

How will you need to explain things differently?
How will the genre of the teaching change?
What will you (or they) likely have trouble with (can you ignore that thing entirely)?
What will you need? What can you let go of?

Here are the ways:

Teach the idea to an academic not in your field.
Teach the idea to a very well read, bookish friend who is not an academia.
Teach the idea to a child.
Teach the idea using something in your home as a prop.
Teach the idea using a metaphor.
Teach the idea using a lecture.
Teach the idea where you don’t speak and the students come to the realization on their own.
Teach the idea using no technology.
Teach the idea in the worst way.
Teach the idea in three words.

Etc. etc. You might come up with your own! The number of ways is arbitrary, but the important takeaway is simply that the ways are numerous. Success in the activity does not come from finding the one perfect approach. It comes from trying on new things. And then another. And another. When all is done, you might take a look at how your thinking has changed over the course of the exercise. What was especially challenging? What seems like it would be the most fun to teach? What will be your way?

The current formulation for Praxis has the students carrying out a small-scale hackathon in the spring as a way of practicing the various intersecting pieces of the curriculum they’ve learned throughout the year. The segment is meant to draw together lessons in project development, humanities programming, and critical approaches to design. We have a few moments in the year to scaffold the process leading to the hackathon and help the students come to a shared sense of their goals and activities for that time before the event itself. In describing how the process will work for the students, I proposed that we start with a working definition for digital projects. After all, groups always struggle to define parameters for their work. Shared definitions and milestones can help make that process easier.

a digital project = a digital method applied to a particular object of study

And, for the purposes of the hackathon, we’re describing an object of study as a contextualized set of materials that serves as a point of intervention for a broader range of interests. Given this, we have a few components to sort out before we start: the group’s shared interests, an object of study that reflects them, and a digital method to apply to that object. Given these three components, we’ve set a few conversations throughout the year to develop them together.


In October the group will meet to define their shared set of interests. The staff will provide context for hackathons as a genre and help to poke these interests in directions that feel feasible. This is how the pre-work for the session is described on the curriculum:
  “Get together as a group to find a broad shared topic/interest that will be the subject of the hackathon. Not thinking objects of study or materials at this point - those will come later. Just subjects/topics. We’ll discuss and help narrow as a group.”


In late November the group proposes a few objects of study with that reflect those interests (thinking datasets, collections of materials, etc.). The staff will workshop these with the students to find materials that feel workable within the timeframe. This is how we described the pre-work on the curriculum:
 “Given your shared interests, come to the session with some sense of what your object of study will be to explore them during the hackathon. What will your materials be? They have to live on the web somewhere. Could come with 1-3 things as options and we help narrow. You will come out of the session with the data source that you’ll then play around with over the winter in preparation for first steps in the spring.”


In January, the group proposes 2-3 particular digital methods to explore that object of study. Again, the staff help push and shape in the direction of what feels possible. This will give us some time to supplement our general humanities programming instruction with a few sessions geared to their specific interests. The curriculum again:
 “Given your proposed objects of study, come up with 2-3 approaches to them that interest you. We will try to get them to narrow to some methodological constraints, but we’ll try to keep this data or Python oriented. This will allow Shane to structure the CodeLab instruction a little more.”


And, finally, the hackathon takes place over the course of four weeks in April. In making it that long, we’re stretching the typical bounds of the genre. But the longer period allows us to jettison some of the toxic working conditions of the format and hopefully find a happier balance between marathon and sprint.


Of course, this definition of DH projects is limiting–other contexts might define them differently. I don’t think every digital project needs a method associated with it, for example, so I’m not sure I would even subscribe to this particular working definition in most of my work. Think of this formulation as an enabling fiction with the goal of drawing out certain kinds of DH work–we’ll discuss others at different points throughout the year. Hopefully, though, the hackathon process helps students new to project design, DH collaboration, and hackathons get some orientation to the process.

Praxis is wrapping up its unit on community building within digital humanities. The opening segment of the year is meant to welcome the students into the lab, get them thinking about how this space might be different than what they’re used to, and illustrate how alternative spaces like these enable different kinds of work to take place. This section of the year has the following activating questions:

What constitutes a community in DH? how will we design one together? how do DHers articulate these practices in public? how do you publish on DH community? how do you find your way into these communities as individuals just starting out?

And this cohort specifically engaged in the following questions:

Who are we? who are we not? who is in the room? who is not? what assumptions does the room make? what is the nature of our community? how will we build and maintain and generous and equitable environment? what are our hopes and dreams? our daily practices? how do I intersect with the group as an individual? how does the group intersect with the world outside? how do I? how are communities formed and reformed? how can we create a community mindful of our own biases and the systems of power in which we swim?

The cohort explored these topics by writing a group charter (a statement of values that they want to put into practice together) and designing plans for self-study based on various presentations from the lab community. The goal is for them to examine how the various communities within the lab and the field more generally intersect and how they might find their own particular way of intervening.
We’re about to move on to a new unit on teaching and learning, but I wanted to offer a few words on how things all fit together. We cover a variety of topics throughout the year:

Communities
Teaching and learning
Research infrastructure
Practice (under which I’m broadly including our technical curriculum)

Of course, it’s impossible to separate any one of these segments from the others. We might visualize their interconnectedness like this (pardon my handwriting).

So, as we shift out of focusing on community and towards the other units this year I wanted to offer a few questions one might ask to help activate community considerations in the other forthcoming topics.


Teaching and learning
What assumptions do our pedagogies make about who is in the room? how do our physical learning spaces include or exclude? what are small community-building practices we can implement each day to create the collective we want? how might we draft community agreements like charters with our students? do our syllabi fulfill the same purpose? if not, why is that? what are the thousand small acts of teaching and learning that we engage in everyday, and how do those invite or push away students and collaborators?


Research infrastructure
Take any given solo-authored research activity–what is the large, unstated community of collaborators behind that work? how might we most generously credit all those involved in digital projects? how does the institutional position of digital work affect its nature and who is allowed to participate in it? what audience do we imagine for our work? how might any given research activity cultivate a specific community that will live beyond it? what kinds of values documents–MOUs, charters, etc.–can we offer to help intentionally shape our research practices?


Practice
How do the technical choices we make reinforce or undercut systemic power imbalances? how can we make our technical practice as inclusive as possible? what daily practices might we implement to turn solitary activities into collective ones (paired programming, code review, etc.)? how do our past histories with digital methods inform, strengthen, or frustrate our efforts to put them into practice today? how are those past histories shaped by politics, systemic power imbalances, identity, and more? how can we pay forward our successes to others and learn from our failures?


All parts of our work are informed by the communities at the center–or periphery–of them. And that community-building is not a one-off activity–it is the result of hundreds of small practices. Questions like these can help us to center and intentionally cultivate group identity and the audiences for our work.
Much more to say, but I’ll leave it there since each of these topics will get their own post later on.

I posted this summer about how I’ve been doing more DH listening–podcasts, lectures, workshop recordings–as a way of keeping up with the field in the cracks of the day. In that post I started a running list of things I’ve been checking out, and I just added a few DH-relevant audiobooks to that post as their own section. While they’re not as easy to come by free, you can still find a fair number of DH-y audiobooks included as part of subscriptions to other services or provided by your local library.
I’ve just finished three audiobooks and started a fourth:

Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy by Siva Vaidhyanathan
Mindfulness for Teachers: Simple Skills for Peace and Productivity in the Classroom by Patricia A. Jennings
Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy by Tressie McMillan Cottom
Play Anything: The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games by Ian Bogost

All very doable in this format, and all related in some way to the work that I do.
Interestingly, even though each of these texts comes from a very different domain, they all share a common concern with systems and the ways individuals engage with them. Vaidhyanathan writes at great length about the ways Facebook sets up dialogic structures that are antithetical to democratic practices of deliberation and debate. McMillan Cottom’s work concerns the ways in which the conditions of credential creep in the labor market create an environment ripe for exploitation by for-profit colleges and leave students paying the price. Jennings describes mindfulness practices as a means for refocusing classroom practices towards attention, wellbeing, and emotional work, both a pedagogical and individual response to difficult professional circumstances. And Bogost’s book asks us to consider the creative navigation of systems of limitations–and the pleasure it affords–as something we can direct to all parts of life.
I’ve been enjoying this new phase of my listening a lot. Historically I never really got to read long-form texts unless I had a specific research reason for them. I was much more likely to read blogs or articles to keep up with the field. But I have found myself much more likely to take in large works as audio in bits and pieces.
Consider this a plea to the world for more academic audiobooks.

I used to blog regularly, but that publishing schedule happened roughly whenever I felt like it. During the pandemic I experienced a series of personal and professional challenges that caused me to slow things down considerably across the board. The result was that my writing schedule ceased–I simply did not have the energy to blog on top of other things. This past summer I set a goal for myself to post once per week as a means of trying to force myself back into a blogging mindset.
I managed to stick to that rough schedule, partially due to a concentrated sprint early in the summer that gave me a backlog of posts I could use downstream. Now, at the end, I am surprised to find that things cohere more than expected. As a means of putting a button on the experience, I’ll close with this post, meant to conclude the sprint but also to serve as a persistent introduction to the collection of work. In what follows I’ll introduce the collection, reflect on the process a little bit, and reorganize the various posts into a set of thematic groupings. Consider this a table of contents, introduction, and conclusion all at once.
Publishing weekly was, of course, too much. Anyone could have told me this. I even would have advised myself against it. I usually tell my students to aim for regular posts to blogs or social media on a sustainable basis, a steady trickle rather than an intermittent flood. But the crunch of this writing push was quite intentional. I’m a very process-oriented person, relying on regular daily practices as opposed to big sprints on things. I live my work life out in Pomodoros. I wrote most of my dissertation at 5:00 AM in 750-word-a-day chunks (using an online system that rewarded me with kitten photos with each milestone). This probably goes back to an old adage I heard learning music growing up: it’s better to practice every day for an hour than for seven hours once a week. My hope was that a weekly posting schedule would force me into a daily writing practice of some shape. This worked to a degree, though of course with the needs of daily life such a schedule is unsustainable. I settled into a regular practice of returning to writing in a few inconsistent and intermittent sessions per week. Perhaps most importantly, I started to divide those sessions between writing, proofing, prepping, and publishing in ways that worked well for me. I’m an endless tinkerer, and it’s easier for me to hold myself back if I know I’m not supposed to be adding new content when I sit down.
Another side effect of the sprint was that I found myself writing different kinds of things than had been my habit in recent years. I wanted to use the summer to push myself towards different scales in part to prove to myself that not everything needs to be a big Statement™. This experiment was largely successful–I found myself posting on tool tips, resources I was putting together, one-off teaching exercises, and generally just documenting a lot of approaches I take to conversations 1:1 with students. New topics also brought new lengths. I was pleased to see an estimated reading time of one minute on one post. I have always loved this about blogging–that the genre is what you make of it–but it was a lesson I had started to forget over the years. I also found myself more likely to bring in my other interests–music most often–that might otherwise get left out of DH pieces. In short, the need to publish pulled me along the path to innovation. I used to write blog posts one at a time, but I developed a habit this summer of having several posts in various stages of publication at once. Some of my writing time was spent just brainstorming a list of topics and titles for future posts, which I found useful for providing a well I could return to periodically for new ideas. This process was very different from my old approach to developing new posts, where I waited to feel like I had a complete statement before writing.
Multiple people across platforms commented on my ongoing writing with some version of “I’m enjoying this series!” Comments like that were, of course, appreciated. But they were also a little surprising. Was this a series? The conversations got me thinking about the point at which a collection coheres, when parts become a whole. I’ve had the goal of blogging my way towards a book proposal for a while, and some of the things I wrote about were in that direction. But, in other ways, the posts I wrote this summer felt like a pretty loosely associated set of topics only connected by my own interests. Does it matter if your writing coheres across pieces? Does it do so simply by virtue of occurring in the same space in a compressed span of time? Is a snapshot of writing at a particular point in time useful on its own? I took a step back and was surprised at the degree to which they do actually cohere, particularly when reorganized thematically rather than chronologically.
I’m certainly not the only one still blogging, but it’s common to hear that the field has mostly moved on from the practice, at least in the way in which the early 2010’s saw not just a network of DH blogs but also consistent engagement happening in the comments. Given this context, why do some of us still blog? Counting this piece, this summer I wrote 15 posts totaling about 17,250 words. Through it all, I found that the pieces share a core set of interests. I’ve always felt that controlling my own publishing process was a way to control my own professional narrative, to write the work into existence the way I wanted, separately from an external academic publishing pipeline. And the core goal of my work in this space, now more than ever, remains sharing as a virtue in itself. I like to think of blogging, in its purest form, as a letter to myself in the past. What do I know now that I wish I had known five years ago? What practices might I want to share back? I covered a broad array of topics here: video game writing, music, teaching, technology. But there are no descriptions of domain-specific research in progress in my posts this summer. What you find, instead, are reflections on teaching and program administration in the hope others might benefit,  resources for professional development aimed towards students and early-career professionals, and more. Across the board, the aim has been to share things that might be useful to others. I found that they can be organized into four rough groupings: Meta-DH, Resources and Documentation, Professional Development, and Reflections on Writing.
I’ll be slowing down considerably after today–the weekly pace was never intended to be an ongoing thing, though I might return to it next summer given the rhythms of my work life. I’ll be hoping to find regular intervals that keep the writing alive that won’t burn me out. In the future I’m going to downgrade to probably biweekly posts at most, monthly posting more likely. I’ll be continuing to blog in the direction of larger and longer writing projects. And I’ll keep experimenting with scale and form. But this was an interesting experiment in sustained writing activity over a span of time. I’ll probably return to this format again in the future. If you’ve made it this far thanks for reading! If you’re finding your way to this little collection of work for the first time I hope there’s something in it that you will find useful.

For years and like many in DH, Twitter was my main connection to the larger DH community, both to share my own work and to see what was going on in the field. I never felt that I was consistently active on the platform, but I had accumulated a modest following over the course of the last decade more by virtue of consistency than anything else. I was always convinced most of those were bots, but I did come to cherish the little cohort of DH regulars that interacted in that space. It was how I learned about the field, found jobs for students, and generally stayed connected.
The platform has long been fraught, a wildly different experience depending on your identity and work. But things feel different now. This summer’s writing sprint coincided neatly with Twitter’s ongoing implosion due to Musk’s mismanagement (the platform became X since this post was first drafted). I’ve largely refrained from posting there for a few months as the ties between the app and far-right politics felt increasingly difficult to ignore. The platform’s continued decline has caused an identity crisis for a number of DH folks. Even for those that remain, it’s clear that the collection of DH users there is not what it once was. Where has our DH community gone since Twitter? How would I find them? Quinn Dombrowski has posted about their experiments building community on Mastodon, and I’ve been exploring that space slowly and haphazardly. My colleague Will Rourk has found some exciting success posting about his 3D scanning with his students on LinkedIn. Bluesky seems most promising to me, as a growing cluster of DH folks seems to be making their way there (more on Bluesky at the end of the post). I now am juggling half a dozen social media apps for work, where I used to have just one. Which of these platforms would work for me? Is it possible to just work in one?
The writing sprint gave me an opportunity to test my own network and try to answer some of these questions. In the before times, I would have tweeted each blog entry with a couple ICYMI posts to make sure I got coverage. I might occasionally post to Facebook. But I didn’t think more of it than that. The audience was on Twitter, and it was all I had. Now I had a range of apps to test. I signed up for TinyAnalytics, a free and privacy-conscious alternative to Google. Each time I posted, I shared the link using the same language to the same set of platforms:

the #community channel shared by the UVA Library and the Scholars’ Lab slack teams
Mastodon
Facebook
LinkedIn

There are all sorts of issues with this “study” of mine. I was fairly new to Mastodon when I started this series. I’ve been on Facebook for years, but my community there consists mostly of friends along with the occasional DH colleague. I’ve largely just had a placeholder LinkedIn profile. I could have added Instagram, but I tend to leave that exclusively for music content. And I only started using Bluesky towards the end of the summer. While there is nothing rigorous about the analytics work I’m doing here, I still found the results interesting.
Mastodon and Slack combined for 70% of the referrers to my site over the summer (my analytics lumps both under “direct links” and can’t differentiate between the two). I assume that figure mostly comes from Mastodon given the difference in engagement I noticed in each space. Even though the platform is newer and my community smaller, the people there seem more likely to engage than folks ever were on Twitter. Smaller audience, higher impact. Interestingly, it also seems to be largely a different audience, perhaps because I’m on the Humanities Commons server and not on anything specific to digital humanities. Not everyone from Twitter made the move over. I had expected it to feel like I was posting into a void, but I wound up with the sense that I could still get writing out there.
My old habit of sharing exclusively to Twitter made some assumptions about my audience that this experiment made clear. As folks spread to different platforms, I also found myself reaching communities that I never would have expected. I had a local artist come up to me at a recent music gig and talk to me about the blogging I had been doing - a first! Grad school friends who I never would have expected to take an interest in this particular work pinged me to talk about the writing. Our union organizer appreciated a post Ronda Grizzle and I co-wrote about facilitating meetings. I started to think of my work less as specific to a DH public audience and more as an overlapping set of publics with different interests and priorities.
Students regularly ask whether you need to be on Twitter to participate in digital humanities. My answer has always been complicated. Up until a year ago, I would have said you certainly don’t have to, but the platform, for all its risks, could connect you to communities you never would have imagined. At present, I would discourage anyone from joining it for the first time given its politics, mismanagement, and the fragmentation of the digital humanities community in that space. Instead, I would encourage folks to explore alternative platforms. For now, I’m bullish on a combination of Mastodon and Bluesky as a viable path forward. I’ve found that each of these two spaces has their uses. Bluesky, especially, has seen a growing number of DH folks join and participate in it in the weeks since I drafted this post (I am one of those latecomers!). You need an invite code to join, but there is a small handful of folks soliciting the community on a regular basis for codes to give to DH folks looking for access. Quinn Dombrowski and I put together a google form for soliciting invite codes and sharing them out if you have them. So far we’ve connected about 60 folks to the platform, so please join and engage! Quinn also noted that ACH is developing a working group aimed at reconnecting the DH community on the platform and building into a positive one for us. So watch that space for further developments. If you’re joining for the first time, check out Mark Sample’s DH feed and add yourself to it (currently has about 125 people in it). I’m hopeful Bluesky will continue to grow into a workable alternative, particularly in conjunction with Mastodon for a broader, less DH-focused reach.
I’ve always felt social media was what you made of it. If you never posted, your network would never grow. If you regularly engaged, you would find an audience for your work overtime. The platforms also offered clear diminishing returns at a certain point: harassment, mental health anguish, a time sink, and more. All the same, this summer has made it clear to me that I need start engaging intentionally again. The DH world is still figuring out where to land, but it’s clear to me after this summer’s experiment that social media can still be a viable way to reach an audience. Even though it feels like I’m starting over, I was pleasantly surprised at the engagement I’ve found this past summer. The process has reminded me of something I had forgotten: blogging feels worth it to me even if you get only a handful of engaged readers. You can still find those even in the fragmented social media ecosystem.

Applications are now open for Praxis Fellowships to be held during the 2024-2025 academic year. Further details below about this application cycle, which has applications due November 1st, 2023. Consider spending time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2024-2025 cohort - Monday, September 11th, 2023 from 11:00-12:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities, offered by the UVa Library’s Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students each year as they explore various aspects of digital humanities together. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, and share a range of digital humanities activities over the course of the year. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to equip fellows with the skills necessary for future research, teaching, and administration within digital humanities.
Praxis training takes a variety of shapes meant to reflect the full-range of DH work.  As a part of their training with us, student cohorts regularly publish a range of values statements describing the intentional communities they want to build together. They also design and teach digital humanities workshops based on their own interests as a means to exercise minimalist pedagogical approaches to DH. Students design speculative projects and events that might go on to be implemented by the Lab. They also participate in a range of technical and design activities meant to reflect the range of digital practices they will encounter in their research. At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named projects. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. 
We welcome and encourage applicants to discuss how your particular backgrounds and identities, whatever that might mean for you, factor into your unique ability to contribute to the program.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we can certainly accommodate travel needs).
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. Students outside of GSAS or whose teaching would already be relieved through other sources during the fellowship year should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility given their particular cirumstances.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from a committee about your application. To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiousity can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Monday, 11/27 from 11-12 or 2-3; or Wednesday, 11/29 from 10-11 or 2-3 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview);
Anything else we should know? - pronouns, a name you go by other than the one on your email, any other experiences or backgrounds you want to make sure we are aware of, or anything else you would like to share.

In addition, we ask for a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that the application can affect teaching rosters).
The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program. We recommend applicants start by reading our charter and a blog post on “Questions to ask When Applying.”
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due November 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

Michael Levenson, my dissertation director, always had great ice breakers. I most remember one that opened a graduate class on Henry James and Joseph Conrad: “What do you read for?” Separate from research questions per se, this was an invitation to think about what made a passage pop to us, what was at the core of our interest in particular topics. I remember saying that I often found myself writing about problems, puzzles at the core of passages that didn’t make sense. A friend noted how he was drawn to conflict and politics. Another cited interpersonal relations as the thing that drew them in. I marveled at how rarely I thought about the foundational interests in my research areas. What is it that makes one put down the book and pick up the pen?
For over two years now I’ve been writing for Backlog, “a video game newsletter for people who are behind on videogames.” Writing about a different subject for a public audience has been invigorating, not least because it forces me into new topics than I would otherwise have posted on in this space. Now that I’ve published to Backlog ten times (with an eleventh piece on the way), I thought I might take the opportunity to step back and apply Levenson’s exercise to my writing on video games. It’s easy enough to pick out the genres of games that I like: role playing, Soulsborne, and simulations to name a few. But, besides play, what drives my curiosity? What makes me put down the controller and text Backlog’s editor with an idea? In what follows I’ll take my list of publications, group them loosely based on topic, and offer a few quick observations.
Self-reflection
My essay on Sekiro and its connections to therapy was the piece that editor Grayson Morley first asked me to share to Backlog. That work also laid down one consistent throughline in my games writing. What do games teach us about ourselves? Returnal struck me for its dreamlike exploration of trauma and grief. And my experience of Skyrim was largely one in which I wanted to ignore the game’s chosen narrative and write my own, quieter story. Games that make you think about ourselves are often the ones that stick with me once the controller is laid to rest and the console cools down.

“Skyrim and a life ignoring destiny,” Backlog, February 16, 2023.
“Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and confronting yourself,” Backlog, December 29, 2021.
“Returnal and the unbroken loop,” Backlog, September 29, 2022.

Genre machines
Genre is often the first way many of us find games, and it structures so much of the gaming experience. I often find myself interested in those moments when genre is laid bare, when a game is so transparently generic that its core feels hollow or shattered into pieces.  Triangle Strategy struck me as genre in search of a narrative. I found my inspiration for a forthcoming piece on the free-to-play game Royal Match in its absurdly generic advertisements featuring celebrities who appeared to be forced to read the same script against their will. What’s left of a game when it’s all genre, all the way down?

“Royal Match and the Slow Death of the Soul,” forthcoming.
“Backlog draft about Triangle Strategy,” Backlog, November 3, 2022.

The weird
In the last moments of Subnautica, my scuba diving game forgot what water was. I spent hours trying to get out of a pit because my character was the only thing that had forgotten how to swim on a water planet. On Tiktok, players of The Sims chronicle their attempts populating their homes with hellish, glitchy monsters and murder victims. Games are strange. People make them stranger. When things get odd I get writing. Anyone who has played D&D with me will find this no surprise–I tend towards chaos and developing very bizarre characters.

“Subnautica and the glitchy terrors of the deep,” Backlog, July 28, 2022.
“SimsTok and the horrors of domesticity,” Backlog, February 3, 2022.

Playing together
I love co-writing and co-teaching, and it’s no accident that I’ve found myself in a career in which I can make space for both. Academic work always felt isolating, and the joys and tensions of working with other people are part of what drew me to digital humanities. I never really played sports growing up, so my earliest encounter with team dynamics was in cooperative gaming. Backlog has given space for a range of co-op opportunities, first with Morley and then with our colleague Alyssa Collins. One common thread through these conversations has been just how different play is for each of us. In Dredge, Morley dutifully followed the game’s narrative. Collins curled up with a coffee and was content to fish for fun. I zipped away into the sunset, made a pact with the devil, and promptly got eaten by a fish. Games are much more than the mechanics and aesthetics of the software. They exist at the intersection of player and platform, and we each construct our experience in service to–or in spite of–the game’s instructions. Backlog and Backchat (the accompanying podcast) have been fascinating reflections on how a single game can refract into profoundly different experiences for different people.

“Backchat: Dredge,” Backlog, with Alyssa Collins and Grayson Morley, April 22, 2023.
“Nobody Saves the World and exuberant middle schoolers,” Backlog, with Grayson Morley, March 16, 2023.
“Don’t Starve Together and friendship via chaos,” Backlog, with Grayson Morley, June 30, 2022.
“Backchat: Boyfriend Dungeon”, Backlog, with Alyssa Collins and Grayson Morley, June 22, 2023.

Most interesting and, perhaps, unsurprising is that all these intellectual interests are consistent with those I explored in my graduate research. Genre disruption, puzzle boxes, introspective strangeness, connection–those topics easily characterize all of my favorite twentieth-century works of fiction and the things that I read out of them in essays, articles, a dissertation, and more. I’m reminded of a quote from Ulysses - “Think you’re escaping and run into yourself.” When I put down my work for the day and start playing games to relax I can’t help but be intrigued by similar topics. Or maybe Popeye said it best - “I am what I am, and that’s all that I am.” Brandon all the way down, in work and play.

DH is teaching.
End of talk. Can you imagine? A whole talk that is less than five words long.

That’s about the point when my cat bit me to wake me up. He’s been getting me up egregiously early lately, and I jotted down some notes about the dream as I waited for him to finish eating so I could go back to sleep.1 I was giving a conference talk, and Jennifer Guiliano had introduced me by giving me a bag of onions.2 There were shades of the time when a classmate told our Joyce professor he would be submitting a copy of Ulysses for the final exam.
DH is teaching.
What more need be said?
I’ve often said the phrase around the Lab but never thought to write it down publicly. Perhaps I thought such a thing would make me sound too much like a true believer. Or that it was so obvious a statement as to render it meaningless. Or that I was not the first to say such a thing.3 The past several years have seen increasing work on digital humanities pedagogy,4 but this post is not merely a commentary on the importance of teaching as a practice to the field and its development. To say DH is teaching is, rather, to point to the baggy, messy nature of the field and what it means to talk about it to an audience.
Whenever I give a talk on digital humanities, I assume a range of listeners in the room. The wildly interdisciplinary nature of DH means someone is always going to be at sea with some aspect of the material. If I present on topic modeling, some people will know the methods deeply, some will be less familiar, and some will just be there for the disciplinary material I am analyzing and have no sense of what the term means. I have never felt comfortable presenting on digital methods as though everyone in the room is in the know. Instead, I almost always try to present as though someone in the room is learning things for the first time. The Scholars’ Lab has a related XKCD comic on the Ten Thousand pinned to our wall:

The comic assumes that acts of teaching are explicit and intentional moments of pedagogy, but I’ve always found digital humanities to be characterized, instead, by ten thousand small and quiet acts of teaching and learning. It’s such a baggy field – I’ve never felt able to assume there was a shared body of knowledge among the people in and around it. There is always someone on the periphery of the  big tent, always someone coming through the flaps for the first time. Think of the students and early-career scholars learning these methods for the first time. Or the digital humanist experienced in one area but attending a talk more outside their wheelhouse. It’s impossible for any one person to know everything. Any conversation about digital humanities necessarily is an act of teaching and learning for someone, whether the teacher recognizes it or not. Whether or not you’re in the classroom.
What are you teaching? To whom? What kind of student evals would you get?
The cat has finished, so that’s as good a sign as any to go back to sleep and see what other blog posts visit me in dreams.



Perhaps a sign that my subconscious would really like to stop posting once a week? ↩


What can I say–dreams are weird. ↩


Definitely ping me if you or someone else has done so! Would love to credit and have someone to cite about it. ↩

If you’ve followed me on social media for any length of time you likely know that I am a musician. I play horns with The Hard Modes, a group that performs original jazz arrangements of video game music. There’s some slight overlap between my time with that group and my work in the DH world, insofar as people in the DH community often tend to enjoy video game music (Quinn Dombrowski even had us perform for the Animal Crossing: New Digital Humanities series!). But the COVID-19 Pandemic and resultant social distancing the last few years really made the work feel more DH-y as we tried to find ways to keep playing together remotely even while it was unsafe to do so in person. We wound up releasing an album called The Lan Sessions that consisted of tracks where all the individual instruments were recorded separately and at home. Greg Weaver, our bandleader, arranger, and saxophonist, talks a bit about the process of facilitating those remote home recordings in his blog post introducing the project.
Working on those tracks taught me a lot about home recording, music production, and music technology. I found it all fascinating, especially the complicated chain of events necessary to make one of these art objects come to life. For the purposes of this post, I wanted to extract from that experience a generalized workflow for others interested in remote recording projects. Full credit here goes to Greg for his guidance in how to do this work - he helped me troubleshoot throughout, and I am mostly documenting the process he shared with me (for myself as much as for others). By necessity I will stay fairly high level: I won’t be noting which buttons to click in which program for the simple fact that each step along the way is fairly complex and dependent on what software and hardware you are using. You can write whole articles just on what microphone to use, whole books on how to use Finale. Instead, I’ll just aim to give a broad outline of the steps with some context for why they are necessary. I’ll try to connect readers to other resources for more information on how to work through each step. One last caveat: I’m sure there are other ways to do this work. This is just the one we used. The workflow I’ll describe will give you a rough roadmap for going from a planned arrangement to a finished recording.
Pt 1: The Setup


Complete the arrangement.
Perhaps obvious, but it helps to have some sense of what your arrangement will be before moving to prepare things for recording.1 E.g. we will play a melody over these chords followed by two solos and then end in X way. For this workflow you will want to have some sense of the arrangement and the parts before you sit down to start tinkering with next steps. Doing so will save you time, lest you lose work by changing things around too much later on.


Create sheet music for the score and parts.
The next step involves taking your arrangement from abstract idea and making it into concrete parts for your players to follow. The music notation software I use for this is Finale. Another option is Sibelius. These programs are deep. After years I feel I am only beginning to scratch the surface of how to use them.2 Finale lets you easily manage all parts of the sheet music process like quickly transposing to different keys, extracting a score to individual parts, hearing a synthesized version of what things will sound like, and more. At the end of this step in the workflow, your goal is to have a score and, most importantly, individual parts for all your musicians. You’ll have sheet music to pass out, but you’ll more importantly have the beginnings of a template arrangement.
Resource:

I like the tutorials shared on Finale’s own website for getting started with the software.



Export your arrangement as a MIDI file from Finale and import it into a Digital Audio Workstation.
Now that we’re done with sheet music, you will want to export your work to a different piece of software. To do so, you’ll export your arrangement in a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) format to convert your music into data that can be exchanged across programs. Once you export your work as MIDI with all the instruments save as individual tracks, you will create a new empty project in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and then import that same MIDI file.3 I use Logic, but other options are Pro Tools or Ableton. We’ll use the DAW for the remaining parts of the workflow.
Resources:

Exporting as Midi from Finale
Working with MIDI in Logic



Assemble each of your tracks and check them
After importing your project in your DAW, your next goal is to get a series of tracks for your project. You will want:

individual tracks for each MIDI instrument
a metronome track for the tempo

You might have other specific things you’ll want to add, like a four-measure count-in. Things are always a little wonky at this stage, so you will want to check the arrangement pretty closely by listening back to it. At first, every instrument will default to a piano track (this makes drum parts sound especially chaotic). So you will need to assign an appropriate instrument sound to each track to make the piece play back as expected. You also should check each instrument individually. I have found that bass parts, for example, sometimes transfer over an octave or two below where they actually should be and come out quite muddy until you adjust the register.
Resources:

Modify the project’s structure to reflect the arrangement
Once you have everything in Logic and sounding alright, it’s time to tinker with the structure of your arrangement. Sheet music will sometimes expect certain parts to be looped and use notation as a shorthand for this process: pages and pages of repeated sections get shortened to just a page with a few symbols that a player knows to read. But you need your recording tracks to be very literal. Your goal is to make it so that you have a track that can be played start to finish and reflect the actual arrangement you want. Think of it as though you are working towards a blueprint for your group.
 Move things around in your DAW on a macro level to reflect exactly what you want it to sound like. For us, this usually entails taking the solo sections and copy/pasting them a few times so that they repeat as expected.
Resources:

Export the project and share with your group.
Now you have a mockup template for the group that you’re ready to share. You’ll want to export WAV files of each track, including the metronome track. You also might want to export the project as a MIDI track just in case. At this point, we usually share all these files in a Google drive folder and send an email to the group with instructions for recording, the order in which each person should record, and any other project-specific settings.
Resources:

Exporting individual tracks in Logic



Pt. 2: Recording
All of the above is just setup done by the person leading a particular arrangement. At this point, you should have a blueprint for your arrangement and a series of individual tracks for each instrument. The next phase involves each collaborator recording their own part, layering these live recordings together to make a final project.


Get the project
Each person should have access to your shared folder with the arrangement materials. Each collaborator imports the project tracks into their own DAW so that they have the same template to work from. Because we will start mixing live audio recordings with the individual MIDI instruments, the process of importing them will be slightly different. See the resources below for more information. At the end of this step, they should have individual tracks for each instrument as well as a metronome track.
Resources:

Importing audio tracks in Logic



Record their part
Each person should have the full project at this point, broken into individual instrument tracks. The recording process can look wildly different depending on individual setups. For example, each of us recorded with different microphone setups. The construction of your room will affect the sound, as will the distance to the microphone. In my opinion, your best bet is just to start with what you have, listen back, and research how to make adjustments in search of the sound you want. I fell down a real rabbit hole trying to get my trumpet to sound true to life before I learned that the disconnect between my room sound and the recorded track was expected (trumpet needs some reverb and EQ in order to sound “natural”). You can save yourself a lot of frustration by spending time researching tips for recording your particular instrument.
When ready to record, each person will mute the MIDI instrument corresponding to their particular instrument and record their own live part over it. When done, they will export only their recorded track and upload their live materials into a shared folder. If you are planning to use video, you will want your players to record it at the same time. We usually had a phone recording in landscape HD at the same time we recorded audio, clapping at the beginning of the take to make it easier to line up the separate audio and video recordings down the line.
Resources:

Tips for getting started for home recording



Repeat
Each subsequent person repeats steps one and two. The collected multitrack recording builds up over time as each new person adds a new live instrument. With each new track, more of the instruments in the mix are live and not MIDI. You might consider tinkering with the order in which you have people record. Greg had us record the rhythm section first, followed by soloists, followed by a second pass of the rhythm section re-recording their parts with the live soloist. This essentially duplicated some of the same work, but it meant that there was perhaps a bit more of a live feel to the interplay between soloist and accompanists than there might otherwise have been.


Next steps
After everyone has recorded, you’re on your way! At this point, you might send the materials off to be engineered and mixed for consistency (or do so yourself). After all, everyone recorded their parts separately so there is likely to be some massaging needed to make a track that sounds consistent across the board. You might also be interested in cutting together a video to share online based on the work you did. This can be an intense process in its own way, but you have most of the raw materials you need for it. I’ll share some resources below for getting started in that direction. Working on these projects was a long, at times tedious process, but I’m very happy for the experience.

Notes



There can be broad variation in how the arranging process looks. You might plan things entirely on a piano. Or you might skip that step and compose entirely in a program meant for sheet music before sending to a different piece of software to prepare the recording process. Or you could arrange entirely in a Digital Audio Workstation and skip the initial process of making sheet music. For our purposes we used two different programs–one for sheet music and one for mixing–and had to export work between them. ↩


If you’ve never used music notation software before, you can gather their importance from a situation that happened to me in college. I had written parts for an entire band with pencil by hand. After I finished, I realized I had made some significant mistakes and had to rewrite whole sections again by hand. Too many eraser marks make things quite hard to read and take forever to clean up. ↩


In Logic at least, your project will likely ask if you want to import tempo information and ask you to select a frame rate for the project. These are both dependent on the particular project you are planning to do. ↩

I’ve long admired Lisa Rhody’s post on what digital humanists can learn from improv comedy. Besides the excellent message that text conveys on collaboration (always ask how your contribution moves things forward), I always think of that piece as a model for how outside interests can inform the work that we do. For my own part, a lot of how I approach collaboration and digital humanities comes from the world of music. I’ve played in a variety of bands and musical contexts for at least twenty-five years, and my experience as a part of the Charlottesville jazz community especially has long shaped how I work with others. Jazz history is full of lessons for the prospective DHer (or really for any field).1 I’ll focus today on what digital humanists can learn about collaboration and leadership from one the music’s most prominent bandleaders–Duke Ellington.
Ellington’s long career as a director, composer, and arranger for jazz big band is a masterclass in how parts become a whole. Billy Strayhorn described the focus on individuals as integral to Ellington’s compositional approach: “Ellington plays the piano, but his real instrument is his band. Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I like to call the ‘Ellington Effect.’”2 The Ellington effect refers to the distinctive musical heights that can be achieved when catering to the unique capabilities of the musicians in the ensemble as individuals. That is to say, the term also refers to the inseparable link between person and performance. Ellington did not compose for musicians in the abstract. He had specific performers in mind from his regular group. He knew their strengths and weaknesses, and he developed music for their particular voices. A good example of this can be heard in “Concerto for Cootie”, a tune that features trumpeter Cootie Williams moving through a variety of different styles, including his characteristic growling plunger mute. I’ve played that piece, and it can’t help but feel like you’re doing an impression of someone else when you perform it.
To abstract the term outwards and draw lessons for DH, we might replace music with any kind of labor. Approaching work with the Ellington effect keeps attention on the specific people in the room. So many problems occur when working in the abstract rather than with the specific collaborators you actually have. We run up against unrealistic expectations for projects that balloon out of control. We exasperate collaborators and ourselves by making plans that can never fully come to fruition. Or our students might be left out in the cold, lost and confused because we don’t keep in mind how their backgrounds, experiences, or training affect their learning. An approach to digital work informed by the Ellington effect keeps expectations aligned with reality by focusing back on the people at play. The following questions might help guide this person-oriented approach to DH in mind:

Who is in the room?
Who is not?
What can they do?
What can they not do?
What do you expect of them?
Do your expectations line up with those realities?
How can you reorient your expectations to meet reality?

We can go further though. After all, Ellington’s prowess was not just in getting people successfully through a piece of music. The Ellington effect referred specifically to his ability to direct the unique characteristics of individuals in the creation of art, where the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. This principle thinks about individuation as a superpower. Our teammates, supervisees, our students: these people have limits, but they also have possibilities. Careful work to cultivate their skills as individuals can be a means by which the project, the team, or the classroom grow in ways that exceed our own expectations. Collaboration might become art. Some further questions to dig deeper and aim higher:

What are our superpowers?
What about this work especially interests each of us?
What especially excites us outside of this work? How might that point towards unexpected expertise?
What are we capable of that no one else could do?
What different group arrangements do we have (pairs, triads), and how would each of those create a different, unique team?
What might our team name be?
What might our team song be?
How might all of this change the work to be done?

Intentional conversations about group and individual identity like these can lead research and teaching in new directions. That quiet student in the room with an outside interest in film might become easier to draw into conversation if you ask them to speak from that perspective when commenting on a text. That collaborator who has past experiences with life coaching will have a totally unique perspective to give on project design.
To my mind, there are obvious intersections between this approach to collaboration and care work. It’s long been a principle of the Scholars’ Lab to put people first over projects. Our student programs aim to teach the whole person. The Ellington effect in this context refers as much to cultivating individual strengths and caring for weaknesses as it does to the need to make considered space for the lives of those persons. To put a finer point on it, I could imagine someone reading this post and thinking, “Ah this isn’t for me. I’m a professional. This feels too personal. I don’t want to bring my own life into my work, let alone the lives of the people I work with.” Fair enough. This approach to collaboration does bring with it challenges. But I will close by noting that the line between the personal and the professional is often an illusion that reinforces systemic inequalities. Not everyone can so easily draw a boundary between the different parts of their lived experiences. The student grappling with food or housing insecurity cannot help but have it affect their work. The staff person on term-limited, contract employment cannot help but feel the weight of that precarious position intersect with their contributions to the team. The grieving coworker might not be able to work as much as normal. In this sense, I see the person-oriented approach embodied by the Ellington effect as a recognition of reality. The lives in the room might be difficult to reckon with but ignoring them will not make things easier. Intentionally engaging your collaborators as individuals can help to address challenges early, before they fester, and give space for everyone to sing.



There are plenty of negative examples too. Probably not a good idea to throw cymbals at your collaborators. ↩

Several years ago I wrote a blog post entitled “What is Praxis Working on?” The TL; DR of that post was that I regularly have people approach me (students included!) to ask what the current cohort of Praxis–our project-based introduction to digital humanities–is currently doing. Typically, that question is a shorthand for asking after the big, branded final project for the program. In that post, I argued that such questions miss the point: the digital projects our students take on have always been a means to an end to give the students space to practice, but the real projects are the students themselves. And we’re really working on being better for them.
Over the years, we’ve revised the program in a range of ways. We’ve become more systematic about the topics and workshops we offer, coalescing around a more intentional curriculum. Realizing that for all of our teacherly ambitions we did not discuss pedagogy very much in the program, we implemented a pedagogy unit where students pilot DH workshops of their own and document them for others. And a desire for more intentional project development took us down the path of collaborating with library and community stakeholders for the end-of-year projects. Part of this work involved compressing the end-of-year project to make room for these other topics and areas. What had been almost the entire year became two-thirds became one half.
Despite these changes, for the students everything seemed to build towards a singular experience that wound up feeling like the major takeaway and centerpiece of the year. I felt a consistent tension between the goals of the program as we articulated them–an emphasis on process and people over products–and the attempt to have students develop a digital project wholesale from scratch each year. The role of the project was to offer hands-on experiences for their own sake rather than as necessarily a research project in itself, but that was often a tough sell for students. After all, the academy rewards CV lines, and our praxis projects frequently received awards and publications. Of course the students wanted to aim for those possibilities. But no matter how we shaped this process, either giving the students full freedom to design their own final project or more directly handing them something to work on, there never seemed to be a path free of unproductive friction. I think student takeaways from the shared project varied wildly, in part because the cohorts were brought together by an application process rather than shared methodological, disciplinary, or topical interests. If you’re fundamentally uninterested in VR, for example, it can be tough to swallow working on a VR project intensely for a semester just for the good of learning. Some students are able to make that leap. For others that might feel a bridge too far when confronted with the pressure to build a thing by a deadline when they also have their own departmental projects to work on that are more directly relevant to their futures. To put a finer point on it: even as the student cohorts consistently viewed the final project as the real work of the program, the vast majority of our students would not go on to use those specific methods in the future. The real takeaways were everything else around that research project.
At the same time, I increasingly felt that the intense focus on hands-on technical training perhaps misrepresented the kinds of work that we do as digital humanists. Technical work is certainly a piece of the DH world, but the arc of the Praxis year sometimes felt as though, to the students, the experience didn’t start until they were building a thing. I recall a similar experience when I was a young student myself visiting conferences and elder DHers would, soon after meeting me, ask what my digital project was. I always stumbled. remember thinking “Do I have to have one? Is all DH projects? Am I not a DH person unless I have a research project?” The answer, of course, is that you don’t; it’s not; and you are. DH work is not all projects. Or rather - projects and scholarship take many different shapes, inflected by institutional makeup, job roles, local needs, etc.
Put another way: when we say methodological training in the digital humanities, we cannot reduce it to technical skills. So much of our day-to-day work in the lab extends beyond the building of things. Community building. Teaching. Learning. Talking. Thinking. Event planning. Project design and management. These are all measurable skills, and they’ve all been a part of the program since its beginning. Our staff and students regularly publish on them. We wanted the students to see the year as a portfolio of experiences that exercised all these muscles, but the real estate of the curriculum taken up by each of these components was uneven. In the rush to build a thing, we sometimes lost sight of why, for whom, and what was meant to be learned along the way. What was meant to be project-based pedagogy sometimes felt like it was project first and pedagogy second, if at all.
This intense focus on delivering a digital project through the program by the end of the semester often led to weeks and months of sprinting and left students and staff alike burnt out by the end of the year. Taking a hard look at what we were doing, what was working, and what was not was an attempt to honor our charter and “build up people and practices over products.” Is it worth producing a quality digital product at the end of the year at the cost of the hearts and minds of those involved? What are the actual limits of an interdisciplinary group of students to make meaningful interventions in a field that is new to them, that they have varying levels of investment in, and with methods that they are just learning? Might there be a better way that can retain the same lessons, make space for new ones, and lose some of the unproductive friction?
It’s no coincidence that these particular redesigns to the program emerged roughly at the same time as we all continued to reckon with ongoing crises in higher education, public health, and more. Part of our hope in reworking the year was to find the spaces to create the learning experiences we wanted in a more manageable and consistent way. It’s easier for students to see how DH will fit into their futures if they have space to look up and breath during the pace of the year. And staff need the space and flexibility to carry out teaching in a healthy way. Foundational to our pedagogy is the hope that we teach and learn in a way that makes space for life outside the Lab. The changes this year were an attempt to incorporate breath and pause into our program. To take an annual marathon-turned-sprint and convert it back to into a healthy jog. After all, the first marathoner died from the exertion. Not a healthy mentality to base a program around.
All of this is context for what has felt for some like a dramatic shift this year but, to me at least, feels like the logical step forward in a yearslong process of trying to find the best possible way to ground our activities in pedagogy and people first. The old structure I often felt left students too rushed to reflect on their work and the staff too busy to help make space for them to do so. The new arrangement aims to give students time to think through what they are doing and why, and it fosters dialogue with staff because everyone has more space to work. In practical terms, we’ve shifted further towards framing the year as a portfolio of experiences in a series of units, each with their own deliverables.

DH Communities
    
What is this space and how do I fit in? What values will we bring to it?
Deliverables:
        
a group statement of values
individual plan for DH learning for the year




DH Teaching and Learning
    
Now that you’ve found a way into the community, how do you articulate that space and its methods to others?
Deliverables:
        
individual pencil-and-paper DH workshops based on research interests
individual teaching statements informed by digital pedagogy
group workshopping of these materials
group participation in running these workshops




DH Research and Administration
    
How I step into a role of active participation in this community? How do I go about building it with others? And what is next for me?
Deliverables:
        
group speculative project design activities
group event planning exercises
individual research project proposals for what comes next
group workshopping of these materials





This portion of the year opens and closes with a pair of exercises grounded in the students’ individual research agenda. In the fall we design jam on each student’s interests as a way to show them the avenues their work might take in DH. In the spring each student proposes a project they might work on after Praxis, and the group gives feedback on how to make the thing a reality.
At the same time that we shifted things around and reduced the space taken up by the final project, we actually expanded the hands-on technical training for the year. We’ve offered a semester-long introduction to code for several years now as a part of the program that we call CodeLab. That curriculum now has a companion piece in DesignLab, a ten-week introduction to critical approaches to design for Digital Humanities work in a range of technologies. This technical track runs in parallel throughout the year as a lab and meets weekly in conjunction with our other general work. Then, in April, all other work for the program stops and the students engage in a short-term prototyping exercise, somewhere between a hackathon and a semester-long project. The students spent four weeks coming together to scope, design, and begin to implement a small draft of a draft together. This is what has become of the yearlong fellowship projects of past years. Our hope was that lowering the stakes while keeping some of the urgency might allow us a space in which students could still practice what they learned while not overselling expectations or ambitions. The goal is for the students to carry out some project design and methodological experimentation on a small scale as a means of bringing together what they’ve learned in the past year.
We still have some tinkering to do next year, but I’ve been pleased with how the students responded to the changes. My sense is that this group of students has the best sense of where DH will take them next and the technical experiences to get them there, even if this year did not result in a finalized product launched and released to the world. That is to say, the project-building portion of the year feels a bit more commensurate to the other pieces of the year and, to my eye, better reflects the different paths that one might take through DH. Praxis continues to reimagine graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age, even as our definition of that methodological training changes.  I’m very grateful to all of my colleagues for their help in making these changes possible in what I hope is a better and more sustainable program for all of us especially Amanda, Shane, Jeremy, Ronda, and Laura. This work is always a group effort by the Lab staff, and I’m immensely thankful to share community with you.

Blogging more this summer has unsurprisingly meant that I have spent a lot of time on my blog. I noticed that the way I had my site generate category pages had stopped working at some point. I set the whole thing up so long ago that troubleshooting it was hard. My old way involved using a plugin to generate categories, which meant that I needed to host my Jekyll site separately from GitHub Pages. Searching around for other options eventually took me to Long Qian’s post on generating tags in Jekyll, which promised to do a similar approach but with vanilla Jekyll and liquid syntax.
I got their approach working to replace my old system. My old use of categories was pretty restricted though–I had really only used them to create separate pages for my pedagogy, DH Now, and DH+Lib posts. But Quian’s post got me thinking about discovery and my blog archive, so I took things a step further and added just a couple tweaks to their post (based on a Stack Overflow post they linked). I got a little tag cloud visualization working - pretty simple, but I hadn’t thought such a thing was possible in vanilla Jekyll/liquid.

If you’re interested in getting it going on your own, you’ll follow all the steps in Qian’s post. But then the last tag cloud code will need to be modified slightly -

{% capture temptags %}
  {% for tag in site.tags %}
    {{ tag[1].size | plus: 10 }}#{{ tag[0] }}#{{ tag[1].size }}
  {% endfor %}
{% endcapture %}

{% assign sortedtemptags = temptags | split:' ' %}
{%- for temptag in sortedtemptags -%}
  {% assign tagitems = temptag | split: '#' %}
  {%- capture tagsize -%}{{ tagitems[0] }} {%- endcapture -%}
  {%- capture tagname -%}{{ tagitems[1] }}{%- endcapture -%}
  <a href="/tag/{{ tagname }}"><code class="highligher-rouge" style="font-size:{{ tagsize }}px;"><nobr>{{ tagname }}</nobr></code></a>
{% endfor %}

I modified the last couple lines to adapt the Stack Overflow response. You count the number of posts associated with each tag and use that to set the font-size for each link. And then I edited an earlier line to set a baseline font-size of 12px.

Students often ask me during professional development conversations to talk about my own path that brought me to where I am today. I thought I would document a version of that narrative here in the spirit of the “Origin Stories” shared as a part of the Speaking in Code event hosted by the Scholars’ Lab years ago. I found those narratives to be helpful as I was finding my own way, however contextual and idiosyncratic they might be. It’s hard to know where one might walk when the tracks aren’t always clear. Hopefully my own winding path will prove useful to someone else, even with all the caveats I note below about how dependent my own story is on circumstance, luck, and privilege. This post will be a little more detailed than the 1:1 conversations I have with students, and I’ll try to save reflections for the end.
I was a big tech nerd growing up. I played video games obsessively. As far back as I can remember, I told people that I planned on being a video game developer and was going to ride my bike to Seattle to enroll in Digipen. This cross-country bike ride never materialized, in part because in high school I took AP Computer Science and despised it. I did fine in the course, but I absolutely hated the process of writing code with pencil and paper.1 That learning experience turned me off from any potential career in the field. At the same time, fantastic teachers were encouraging my growing interests in music and literature. I wound up studying the latter subjects in college and leaving behind my childhood interests in programming.
When I started my PhD program in English at UVA I had never heard of digital humanities. Fresh out of a terminal MA degree at the same institution, I somehow missed all the DH work going on at UVA already. Even had I heard about it, I probably would have assumed it was not for me based on my past negative experiences learning C++. I was ultimately pulled into the orbit of DH and the Scholars’ Lab by a few historical coincidences:

I started my PhD in 2011
The Praxis Program also started in 2011
During its first year of the program, Praxis did not have a university-wide reputation just yet so the applicant pool was lopsided towards particular disciplines. The first cohort consisted of five students from English and one from Art History.
Because of point three, I knew a lot of people taking part in the Praxis program that first year.

I observed from the outside as my friends got a hands-on, rapid introduction to a range of DH methods and conversations. I saw their work on Prism, a tool for crowdsourcing textual interpretation. At the same time, I was just starting to develop my dissertation topic on sound recordings and literature. My initial interest in DH was based on this work in multimedia. I thought a dissertation on audio might be aided by technology, by thinking beyond the printed page. And the growing reputation of the Scholars’ Lab among my friends was that it was a space in which newcomers and experienced programmers alike could find a home. I thought I would give programming another shot.
I applied for the Praxis program the next year and didn’t make the cut. I was waitlisted, so I assumed that was that–DH wasn’t for me. Shortly thereafter I attended ThatCampVA and sheepishly avoided all the Scholars’ Lab staff based on lingering feelings of rejection. Months later and right before the next academic year I got a call from Eric Johnson to let me know that a student had withdrawn from the fellowship. I hopped off the waitlist and took part in the second Praxis cohort. The Praxis Program for me was a broad introduction to digital humanities development as I worked on a Ruby on Rails application. But I was really struck by the new way of thinking about my potential future and the way that I related to work. More than any new skill (though there were those too!), I took away a new community, one with different values and commitments than I had found elsewhere in the academy.
After the Praxis fellowship I bounced around a few different DH opportunities during the rest of my graduate degree. I project managed for NINES. I worked on the backend of a now defunct website for teaching rhetoric and composition. I started working with Eric Rochester 1:1 to learn about text analysis. And Wayne Graham invited me to co-teach humanities programming at HILT to get some more teaching chops. Laid out all at once like that, it sounds like I had a robust set of experiences professionalizing me in DH, and I was immeasurably lucky and privileged to have had these opportunities. At the time, things all felt very scattershot and taken on by random chance. I jumped at whatever opportunities appeared, but it never felt as though there was a clear path through school towards DH. I never thought of DH as a real career option for me even though I was accumulating a series of experiences in that direction.
Two conversations helped me to see a viable future in DH.
I professionalized during my degree as though I was planning to go on the academic job market. I published, went to conferences, etc. But I remember having a conversation with my dissertation director Michael Levenson towards the end of my degree about how my heart wasn’t in it. I explained to him that I felt pulled in three different directions: my research, teaching, and digital humanities. Michael could really read a room. He generously asked me why I was planning to apply to academic jobs I fundamentally didn’t want and encouraged me to embrace the pieces of my experience that really moved me. “Why would we only want people with PhDs in Universities?” is a quote from that discussion that stuck with me.  Many are not so lucky to have an advisor who was so willing to see futures beyond the professoriate. And many are not so lucky as to have the space and financial ability to determine their futures in this way. I ultimately decided not to go on the academic job market.
I started a long-term relationship with my wife around the same that my advisor helped free my own thinking from pursuing academic jobs for their own sake. She still had a few more years left at UVA in her PhD program, so I suddenly had personal reasons for wanting to stay semi-local. Two regional opportunities popped up on my radar: a developer position working in the UVA Library and a postdoctoral fellowship at Washington and Lee focused on digital humanities. I remember discussing the two job postings with Wayne while walking back from teaching programming together at HILT. I didn’t feel qualified for either position, but it felt like I couldn’t pass up local opportunities like these. Wayne encouraged me to think of my scattershot experiences as valuable. “Would I ever be qualified for something like this?” I asked. His response was generous and supportive. “You’re qualified now - definitely apply.” The Scholars’ Lab provided invaluable help to me as I went through the application process. I ultimately wound up taking the W&L postdoc for a number of reasons. The postdoc was more squarely a digital humanities position. It was also four years (an enormous and unusual length for a postdoc). And while they both focused on programming, I had the sense that the W&L position would be more flexible and allow me to move in different directions.
I stayed in the Washington and Lee position for just 15 months of the promised four years. I had hardly any experience in the small liberal arts scene, and in my time at W&L I came to deeply admire how pedagogy suffused all the work they did. These experiences helped me to shape a body of interests that could join what had until now felt like distinct pieces of my personality. Rather than thinking of DH, teaching, and research as separate, WLUDH showed me that these could all be one and the same. My colleagues at WLUDH made space for the position to grow with me. I still did some development work, but I was free to work more in the direction of pedagogy, curricular development, and OER than intended. I was actually teaching a course when I got a notification that UVA had posted the Head of Graduate Programs position after Purdom Lindblad left to be Assistant Director of Innovation and Learning at MITH.
In this context, the return to UVA, to the Scholars’ Lab, and my current position made a lot of sense. I was returning back to help administer the very programs that shaped me into the scholar practitioner that I had become. The Scholars’ Lab position was an opportunity to take the work I had done at W&L with teaching and return to a program that I could shape for years to come. From a personal standpoint, I was looking at the difference between an 80-minute and a 15-minute commute. And the move was also a jump from term-limited, contract employment to a position in which I was salaried on hard money. All the same, I agonized over the decision quite a bit. WLUDH and my colleagues there (shout out to Mackenzie Brooks and Julie Kane in particular) had made the space a really generative one that I was reluctant to leave. I remember taking a photo of an overlook on Route 81 on the afternoon of my last commute to commemorate the experience. I may have cried as the relief of leaving that commute behind washed over me.
And that’s where I’ve been for the last six years, coincidentally starting work at the Scholars’ Lab on the same day as my supervisor Amanda Visconti. I am eternally full of gratitude to the many mentors, collaborators, and friends who helped guide me on this path and gave advice as I struggled with decisions at hinge points. But I am also keenly aware of how much of my own path is the result of fortuitous  circumstances. Every time we run a fellowship application cycle I think about how my own life was changed by being on a waitlist. Every time I talk with a student I think about how fortunate I was to get the right encouragement at the right time. And I also am fully aware of how much privilege I enjoyed during this journey–both as a cis white man and as someone at a well-funded institution with resources to learn digital humanities. Whenever I see a post for a one-year postdoc I think about how enormously lucky I was to have the security of my multi-year contract at W&L. I want to pay forward the generosity I received to the next generation of DH graduate students, and this is a large part of why I blog publicly as much as I do. Both of my cover letters for the jobs mentioned in this post are available to read. But there is always more work to be done, on the systemic level as well as the individual. I see a direct line between the rambling path I took through graduate school and my current work with UCWVA-UVA, UVA’s wall-to-wall union. As a part of that group I organize alongside graduate students, faculty, and other staff to help make the road walked by the next person a little easier to follow, to make the academy more just and equitable for all. That’s really the subject of another post, though - less about origins and more about the futures we all hope to see in higher education.



To be fair to the teacher, she was modeling the format of the AP exam which would have us write dozens of lines of code out by hand in a booklet. Amanda Visconti has pointed out how ironic this is given my focus on minimalist digital pedagogy that focuses on pencil and paper activities. ↩

When working with students on DH pedagogy, one common question I get is how to run a classroom discussion. After all, some disciplines rely more on lecture-based approaches to instruction than conversation. Running a discussion can feel totally new for students unfamiliar to the format, especially so if the topic is DH-related. I wanted to share a short little trick you can use to ease into the format across topics and methods, including in DH.
A lot of the anxiety new instructors feel about running discussions comes back to silence. Dead air can be terrifying–the exact moment when imposter syndrome will flare up. When you ask a question and no one responds the instinct might be to answer it yourself. But this loop can create a space in which one gestures towards a discussion without actually giving the students space to speak up. Instead of back and forth, you produce what is essentially a lecture with performative discussion elements. Sometimes you do need to jump in. But often students actually need space to think–the silence in the room can be productive, and it rarely feels as threatening to the students as to the new instructor. The trick is to learn how to sit with the silence, to pause thoughtfully. I work through silences using a tactic that I’ve heard framed in different ways by a number of people, but I associate it most with Sophia Gu, a former colleague of mine in the UVA English Department. The tactic involves a pretty simple loop that you put into play whenever you ask a question in the classroom. You count to seven.

Ask a question to prompt discussion.
If you get a response, great! Move on.
If you get no response, count slowly to seven. Take a drink of water, stare at the ceiling, or otherwise busy yourself.
If you still get no response, reframe or clarify the question.
Count to seven again.
If you get to seven and still get no response you answer the question yourself.

I find that the simple fact of having a plan for the silence makes it much more manageable. It gives students the space to ask questions and gives your classroom the chance to have a real discussion.

I’ve always been someone who learns best while listening. And as I’ve gotten older and busier, I’ve had more and more need to find ways to keep up with work while taking care of other things. In the last six months I’ve started to do a deep dive into the DH resources out there available as audio, things that I can absorb during the cracks of the day. In the hopes of finding more, I posted to Mastodon asking if anyone had favorite recordings of DH talks, lectures, or workshops. The post got a fair amount of recirculation but few actual replies with links. That tells me there might be others interested in such materials, so I thought I would start a little running list of what I’ve been checking out and share it out. Keep in mind there is no real attempt at coverage here: it roughly collects whatever I’ve managed to find whenever I manage to check it out (I would love to hear what I’m missing!). So, the list is always going to be incomplete but be growing over time. I’m operating here under the assumption that there is enough here already to make it worth sharing. The scope is also quite broad but also idiosyncratic: there’s a clear focus on DH infrastructure and digital pedagogy given my own work. And I also won’t be keeping track, say, if things get taken down years from now.
What follows is my running list of recordings. There’s no real distinction made below between, say, podcasts you could download on your phone and videos that need to be run in the browser. Such a difference is meaningful but doesn’t really fit my own particular purposes here, so if you have need or one or the other you will have to poke around a bit. I’m using a service called BibBase to embed my Zotero collection on this page, so this post should be updated in the future as that collection updates. You can also explore the collection directly on Zotero’s website. I would recommend this guide by Yvonne Seale if you want to embed a Zotero bibliography in this same way on a page of your own. I also particularly want to shout out Merisa Martinez who shared a list of their favorite DH podcasts a few years ago. Thanks also to Amanda Visconti for suggesting some links on Mastodon. I’ve included those links in the Zotero collection below.
Free Digital Humanities Recordings

DH-relevant Audiobooks
These are longer texts that exist out there as audiobooks. Worth noting, though, that they may or may not be freely available. I found them either through a subscription service (like Audible) or rental from a library.

This post is primarily meant to be a resource for students interested in applying to one of the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowships. I often speak with people 1:1 about their applications to our Praxis or DH Fellows programs. These solo meetings are usually the best way to get to know someone and learn about their work, and I hope students will continue reaching out in this way. But I also always want the process to be transparent for everyone applying, and I want every applicant to have access to the same resources. So in what follows I try to collect the most useful information about how to apply successfully for one of our programs based on what repeatedly comes up in those conversations and at our information sessions (directly pulled from one piece of that slide deck). We always have more strong applicants than we can take into our programs, and asking the following questions of your application can help you to ensure you’re representing yourself in the best light. I also think several of the principles here are relevant to funding applications in general, so I’ll try to flag those moments where specific examples might be abstracted for a generalized approach to grant applications. For more grant-writing advice you might check out Thomas Padilla’s post or one of the NEH ODH’s posts on the topic. If you’re unfamiliar with our student programs, you might take a quick look at the CFPs for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities (referred to below as the DH Fellowship as is our local practice). In what follows I write with the understanding that you know something about them already.
Do you go beyond your research?
It’s not unusual for graduate students to spend a significant portion of their application describing their research. This is, of course, an expected part of your submission. It’s worth knowing, though, that I cannot recall a graduate student whose research was not interesting in its own way. You cannot take that interest for granted, of course, but the determining factors for our application committees rarely tend to come down to the nature of the research itself. Too much extended discussion of your own research in the abstract might not leave enough time to actually make the case for funding your work. In many cases, it can be valuable to develop a succinct way to describe the impact of your work that leaves plenty of space for the rest of your application. It’s often common practice for graduate students to develop elevator pitches for their work. It can be a good exercise to describe the urgency and impact of your work in writing in a similar mode. How would you cover your work in a page? A paragraph? A sentence? Then scale accordingly to the length of the application. Attention to this factor will give your application space to connect your work to the specific questions, values, and categories requested by the grant–you have room to go beyond a mere description of your project. More information below on this.
Do you know what you’re applying for?
One of the clearest ways you can strengthen your application is by rereading the call for applications and checking to make sure you understand the parameters of the opportunity for which you are applying. Then, demonstrate this by speaking to the nature of the experience in your application. This might feel like obvious advice but mismatches between applications and opportunities can often feel like low-hanging fruit for search committees struggling to make a range of difficult decisions. To give a concrete example: the Praxis program is a yearlong, collaborative fellowship. The students work on a range of activities every year. Much of those projects are co-designed by the cohort of students in consultation with and within parameters set by the Scholars’ Lab staff on a variety of topics. The program does not really contain a space within it to develop an original, individual research project. When writing a cover letter for Praxis, though, sometimes students pitch a research project they want the cohort to work on. No matter how interesting such a project might be, applications like these can raise concerns that a student knows what they are getting into. How will such a student feel when they don’t work on what they expect in the fellowship? Another application that directly speaks to the offerings of the program will look stronger by comparison. A better approach might be to describe future research projects that strike your interest while making it clear you are aware your work in Praxis will take you in directions you don’t anticipate.
If you know the opportunity well, you might be able to pitch something more out of the box. I once had a student, for example, pitch a pedagogical experiment for the DH Fellowship that fundamentally offered a critique of how we framed our CFP in a way that excluded research on teaching. This student was successful because they did a good job of demonstrating that they understood the fellowship and its goals, even if the CFP itself didn’t articulate them in the same way. But I would take such an approach with care: turning an application like this successful relies on you having done your homework and probably clearing the approach with a contact for the application (as this student did).
Do you have a plan?
In contrast to Praxis, the DH Fellowship project specifically asks students to propose a digital project to work on with us over the course of the year. Many students are used to describing the research interventions of their project but less familiar with how to describe the execution of a proposed digital project. Much of the CFP is directed towards guiding students through the process of describing how they anticipate that work going, and the strongest applications demonstrate a plan for the year, the technologies they might use, who in the lab will help them, projected outcomes, and more. Take these different hypothetical descriptions of the same project:

I want to make a website for my dissertation.
I want to make a digital archive based on a chapter in my dissertation.
I want to make a digital archive about American protests using Omeka. This project connects to a specific chapter in my dissertation.
Over the next year, I want to build a digital archive about American protest since the 1980s. Specifically, I plan to archive photographs from three important protests using Omeka. I plan to spend the first two months gathering materials and the next three assembling them into a proof-of-concept archive. If I manage to finish this in the time allotted, my future goals are to add new cities. I also think Dr. Nicolas Cage in the Lab could help supervise this work.

You could go far deeper, of course, but hopefully these quick examples show the varying degrees of specificity an application might contain. You do not, of course, need to know everything. If you did, you wouldn’t need us! To some degree this is a question of rhetoric: you can be honest about gaps in your knowledge while also showing that you have made your own best attempt to sketch out a strategy for carrying out the work that you have proposed. Sharing a plan for your work with us, however in-progress that plan might be, will go a long way towards letting the committee know that you know how we fit in and where to start. The DH Fellowship also asks for a review of relevant technology and literature, all of which is by way of asking for evidence that the applicant is already working to prepare themselves for a successful fellowship.
Is the proposal well-scoped?
Different funding opportunities call for different scales. The DH Fellowship in the Scholars’ Lab, for example, can be a bit flexible as outcomes go. We hope to prepare students so that, by the end of the year, they possess a proof-of-concept project with significant milestones as well as the skills to continue working in the future. Every DH shop in the world has been pitched projects that could be the work of a lifetime. Conversely, we’ve also all heard project pitches that estimated they would take a year but could actually be done relatively quickly (the dream!). The best applications are the ones that fit the amount of space and energy that the opportunity will give them, that don’t take a giant square peg and try to fit it in a small round hole. Ask yourself: am I planning on too much? Too little? These questions can often be difficult for students to ask of their own proposed projects, and it’s often best to consult with more experienced folks able to identify parts of a project proposal that might need to be reworked. Scholars’ Lab staff are always happy to help you scope your project before you apply. If you’re new to scoping projects and developing timelines for them, DevDH.org might prove to be a useful resource for basic lessons in project design. One option is to be honest about these difficulties in your application and offer tiered objectives, with some sense of a minimum viable product as well as stretch goals. It’s more difficult to fail if you have reasonably flexible expectations.
Do you address the terms of the application?
The Praxis and DH Fellowship CFPs both offer specific criteria to address in their respective applications in the form of a bulleted list. In each case, there are no tricks–these criteria form the evaluation rubric we use as we read cover letters. To use the Praxis application as an example, here is what we ask for:
To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiosity  can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews…

To go back to the earlier point on going beyond your research interests, note that research interests only directly pertain to one of the several categories we hope to see addressed. Too much space spent on any one category leaves less room for the others. The best applications are the ones that actually address each category in the way that we ask. We have, for example, sometimes gotten a CV or Resumé instead of a letter of interest. That genre mismatch often does the applicant a disservice, as there is less room to reflect on your experiences in those other genres. It’s often a good idea to go back to your materials after you’ve written them to compare them to the CFP as written. Did you address everything? Did you leave anything out?
Lastly - how can we help?
Every funding opportunity is going to have limited resources to go around. We want to make sure that our funding is as transformative as possible for those who receive it. This impact can take many shapes, and to some degree all of the above points are meant to help the committee determine how meaningful we will be for you. The fellowship might extend your research in new and interesting ways only possible with our support. You might need specific digital help with a particular project that you have been unable to get off the ground on your own. You might envision the fellowship as valuable training for careers off the tenure track. All of this points to what is, perhaps, the most salient point of this post, one in which I betray my background as a literary scholar. Grant and fellowship applications are acts of imagination. You are trying to write a particular future into existence. The committee, in its own way, is also trying to look to the horizon with your writing as a guide. When reading applications we try to project a future for the person in our community: will they be successful? How will their time with us prepare them for what is next? The way you structure the application itself can help or hinder this envisioning. Careful attention to the above categories can help make it easier for the committee to align their imagination with yours.

Premise 1: Digital humanities is vast. It encompasses an enormous and ever-growing group of people and institutions doing digital work across a broad range of languages, disciplines, and methods.
Premise 2: Everyone learns something for the first time.1
How, then, is an interested student new to digital humanities supposed to find their way towards the topic, method, or subject that will be their focus? How to find your future when you don’t know the past or present?
While there are many answers to these questions, I have come to rely on one activity when meeting with interested students new to the field. The exercise uses Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. I ask the student to compare their own interests to the collection to find a series of subareas within DH that they might want to explore further. This work usually happens informally in conversation. For the sake of this post and ease of use by others, I’ll write it out as a series of steps as though it were an assignment sheet to be given out to students.

Finding a Way into DH
This exercise will help you map your own research interests onto various areas within Digital Humanities using Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, a massive peer-reviewed collection of artifacts related to digital pedagogy. The site organizes its pedagogical resources around particular topics like access, affect, annotation, and archive, to name a few. Each of these keywords contains a range of materials including syllabi, course projects, classroom activities, and more. And each topical section opens with a short headnote by an editor, expert in that field, contextualizing how that particular topic intersects with the broad field of digital pedagogy. We will make use of this structure to connect you to the field.


Describe your research interests in about a paragraph or so. No need to be lengthy, no need to worry about the audience, and no need to worry about being overly specific. This is for you. Great if you have some sense of what might interest you about DH, but broad and purely disciplinary interests also perfectly fine. We’ll connect them.


Take a few moments to read the table of contents for Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities. What do you notice?


Write down the 3-5 keywords that seem to intersect the most with your interests, the topics that most pop to you as urgent. You might even find that you used some of the same terms in the paragraph you wrote for step one. Taken together, this set of keywords will be the way that you triangulate one view of your relationship to DH.


For each keyword you circled, read the editorial headnote and peruse the artifacts collected under it.


To go further, take note of the other projects and scholars referenced in each editorial headnote. You can practice citation chaining to use this list to further enmesh yourself within your growing network of interests within DH.



Even though the resource in question is pedagogical in focus, I find the activity works well for students regardless of their interest in teaching. The exercise works especially well for folks at a stage of general curiosity but who have yet to find a specific project or interest. For students in this position, it can help them find a way to navigate the vast unknown by finding a constellation of materials close to their interests to get started. For those who already have more of an idea of their interests within DH the activity can facilitate a literature review. The exercise does not aim to be a comprehensive survey of the field. Instead, it starts from the premise that the only way to begin is by beginning–new students often just need guideposts to get started.



In the Scholars’ Lab we have an XKCD comic based around this premise taped to our wall. ↩

I’m going to try to re-enter blogging by intentionally writing short pieces more regularly. Bear with me as I try to find a voice in this new, shorter format. I’ll be breaking things that might otherwise be longer pieces into small nuggets that cover a single topic and then linking them together.
I thought I would start off by documenting some tools and ideas that I regularly use in conversations with students, beginning with how I discuss the range of DH careers with interested students. These talks often start with one key question: what kinds of jobs are out there?
There are several ways to approach to the topic, but I usually start conversations about careers in DH by drawing a very simple diagram: two axes, with the x-axis labeled as breadth and the y-axis as depth. The constellation of work involved in any given digital humanities position can be described in terms of a relationship between the two.

Breadth: generalized work across many different DH topics or methods
Depth: deep focus on a particular DH topic or method

All DH positions will ask you for some combination of these two variables, and any particular position will ask for a specific configuration of skills keyed to these axes. There is, of course, a degree of tension between the two categories: expertise tends to come at the sacrifice of generalized knowledge. Put another way, you can’t possibly know everything about everything (some jobs do ask this of you - a major red flag). I intend no value judgement in any direction with this way of thinking. Depth does not correlate to value or intellectual rigor: a position asking for specific expertise is not inherently better than one asking for broad surface familiarity. They’re just different.
To help students through this way of thinking, I then pull up our own staff page and chart a few positions along these axes. A couple examples at the extremes:
GIS Specialist - depth
We have two GIS specialists in our Lab that work on digital mapping needs for the entire university. These are perhaps the best examples of highly specialized positions because they quite literally have a particular area of focus on the title. The bread and butter of these kinds of positions entails deep work on a small number of methods. Another good example might be a DH developer hired to work on a specific DH grant project with a particular tech stack. If you’re hired as a developer for a Ruby on Rails project, your work will likely be primarily in Ruby on Rails.
DH Librarian - breadth
By contrast, some positions are more likely to be pulled in many directions and asked to know a little about a lot of things. A librarian usually provides support to whatever researchers come through the door. For example, I am not an expert in digital archives or digital mapping, but I know enough about these methods to have introductory consults with people and point them towards the right tools. There are others with more expertise I can send them to if they need further help. While I do have my own specialties (digital pedagogy and text analysis), my position also involves a mix of administrative, teaching, and development work and asks me to have surface-level knowledge of many areas. That work is often quite general, skewed towards breadth as opposed to depth.
Of course, most positions are likely to be murky, in the vast grey area between the two extremes. Faculty positions in digital humanities are perhaps instructive in this way. I would characterize these positions as rewarded by deep expertise and focused work in a smaller selection of topics. A DH faculty member might, say, work extensively on digital mapping and seek funding to that effect. But, at the same time, a faculty member might be called upon to design a DH curriculum or read DH grant applications on a broad array of topics. There is a push and pull between breadth and depth, each with their own rewards and risks as they pertain to the tenure and promotion process.
The tension between breadth and depth is further inflected by a range of other variables. The institution offering a job will affect its scope, as a library will have a different portfolio of work than, say, an art museum. Scale is another important factor: the larger an institution’s staff, the more likely it is for positions to be more highly specialized.
As with all binaries, this one breaks down under too much scrutiny. But I’ve still found it to be a useful starting point for getting students to think through the different types of futures for which they might prepare. My general advice to students is to think about how they might map themselves onto the axes of breadth vs depth. They should not feel compelled to be experts in everything, as they may get so lost in the pursuit of deep knowledge in one field that they never move on to another. By the same token, if there are one or two fields that really interest them, it’s okay to dive into those areas, rather than positioning themselves as generalists. In fact, I encourage students to select those topics and methods that they will approach in depth and distinguish them those from those that only require familiarity. This approach can help to make the process of professional development more manageable. And when trying to prepare for any given DH job ad they might find a student can ask: how broadly does this job ask me to go? In what directions?

I was recently asked to give a workshop for the Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium on how to manage the logistics for semester-long course projects. The result was something I came to call “Against Projecting: Planning DH Course Projects the Work for You.” The goal of it was to take that question and really get to the underlying pre-issues that, if ignored, can make things in the classroom much more difficult. That is to say - before we even get to the how of digital course projects we need to think through why we want to include them, what resources we have to support the work, and what shape they will take.
Here’s the abstract:
Many instructors include digital projects as the logical final assignments in digital humanities courses. Doing so introduces a host of challenges, however, and it can become all too easy to feel committed to the idea of the digital project in a way that overwhelms our course goals, our students, and ourselves. From a practical standpoint, this workshop will explore ways to manage the logistics of planning for the incorporation of course-long digital projects into teaching. From a theoretical one, this session will examine our reasons for doing so and how better to fit our project plans to our teaching rather than the other way around. The session will be structured as a mix of lecture, discussion, and activities, and participants will come away with a clear sense of next steps for integrating digital projects into their courses. In our limited time, the workshop will aim to deliver a series of tools and activities that participants can take with them to work through as they plan their own courses. Topics covered will likely include learning goals, resource assessment, scaffolding, assignment strategy, and outcomes, all filtered through the lens of project management for teaching and learning.
DEFCon records all their talks, so if you’re interested in more you can check out the video on their YouTube page (also embedded below). It’s a fantastic community - highly recommend following thier work!

Applications are now open for the 2023-2024 Digital Humanities Fellowship cohort.
The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2023-2024 academic year is February 15th, 2023. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2023-2024 cohort - Tuesday, January 17th, 2023 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, encouraged to write to Brandon Walsh for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can begin your application.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,000 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia. We have received some questions about how the Scholars’ Lab Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities will be affected by new departmental support packages. Going forward, including for the coming academic year, the Scholars’ Lab fellowship will provide $24,000 in living support during the academic year, and the package will include health insurance, fees, and tuition remission. No teaching is required as a part of the fellowship. Students will apply to this fellowship in their fifth year of the PhD for a sixth year of funding in conjunction with the Scholars’ Lab. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both Brandon Walsh and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The student’s Director of Graduate Studies must approve the student’s application.
The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue (no more than two pages);
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that holding the fellowship can affect teaching rosters);
and your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot: February 23rd from 10-2 or 2-4 or February 24th from 1-3. This should be communicated in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together.

Applications are now open for the 2023-2024 Praxis Program cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2023. Consider spending some time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2023-2024 cohort - Tuesday, January 31st, 2023 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities, offered by the UVa Library’s Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students each year as they explore various aspects of digital humanities together. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, and share a range of digital humanities projects and activities over the course of the year. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
At times, Praxis teams have developed and launched specific, named projects. Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family, and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Students developed Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA’s real estate development since the 1980’s, and Connection Established, an immersive examination of university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most recently, students shared Your Name Here, a project that aims to empower students with the coding skills and confidence to create a personal website that reflects who they are and what they value in public. As a part of their training with us, student cohorts have published a range of values statements. They have also designed and taught digital humanities workshops based on their own interests.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups. We will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we are flexible and can certainly accommodate travel needs). We will monitor public health to ensure such meetings are possible–we have successfully held the program remotely during the pandemic.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. Students outside of GSAS or whose teaching would already be relieved through other sources during the fellowship year should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility given their particular cirumstances.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

What brings you to us? - a description of the applicant’s curiosity in the program, (could include a description of proposed use of digital technologies in research if relevant, but interest and curiousity can be valid starting points as well);
How do you work? - a narrative about how the applicant approaches collaboration and learning;
What do you bring to the table? - summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
What do you want out of this? - summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
When can you meet? - your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Tuesday, 3/21 from 1-3 or Wednesday, 3/22 from 1-3 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview). Shortly after these group interviews, we will notify applicants who advance to schedule follow-up interviews should we decide such a round is necessary.

In addition, we ask for a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s department chair stating that they are aware the student is applying for the fellowship and support the application (given that the application can affect teaching rosters).
The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due March 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

Have a digital project you’d like to work on in conjunction with your dissertation? Applications are now open for the 2022-2023 Digital Humanities Fellowship cohort.
The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2022-2023 academic year is February 15th, 2022. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2022-2023 cohort - Tuesday, January 18th, 2022 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, encouraged to write to Brandon Walsh separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can begin your application.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1 The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both Brandon Walsh and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.
The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
a brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant’s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;
and your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot, either on Wednesday, February 23rd from 2-4 or on Thursday, February 24th from 10-12. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to express their interest and (once an application has been submitted) to let us know you have applied. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with this fellowship or otherwise.



Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award. ↩

Calling UVA graduate students! It’s time to start thinking about next year. Applications are now open for the 2022-2023 Praxis Program cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2022. Consider spending some time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2022-2023 cohort - Tuesday, February 1st, 2022 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend**.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family, and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Most recently, students developed Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA’s real estate development since the 1980’s, and Connection Established, an immersive examination of university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. The Scholars’ Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups. We will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we are flexible and can certainly accommodate travel needs). We will monitor public health to ensure such meetings are possible–we have successfully held the program remotely during the pandemic.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
and your availability on the days and times we’ve identified for group interviews: Monday, March 21st from 1-3; Tuesday, March 22nd from 10-12 or 3-4 (you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview). Shortly after these group interviews, we will notify applicants who advance to schedule follow-up, individual interviews to take place on March 28th and 29th.

The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due March 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

At MLA 2021, I was part of a panel  on “Perspectives on Digital Humanities Publishing” along with Jojo Karlin and Matthew K. Gold; Radhika Gajjala; and Gabriela Baeza Ventura and Carolina Villarroel. The lightly edited text of my talk follows along with my slides. As always, I tend to use the text as an outline and then expand or contract sections in the moment. More information on that strategy for public speaking can be found here.

Hello! I’m Brandon Walsh, Head of Student Programs in The Scholars’ Lab, a center for digital research in the University of Virginia Library. I’m also on the editorial board for The Programming Historian, and I’ll be talking today about the editorial processes we use to guide new lessons from submission to publication. In particular, I’ll be focusing on the technical platform we use for these workflows and how those technologies intersect with and inform the process itself.

I wanted to express gratitude up front to my co-presenters and to those whose work feeds into this talk. I, of course, need to thank the entire Programming Historian team, but it feels especially important to thank and acknowledge the non-English language teams working on the project–the Spanish, French, and (very soon!) Portuguese versions of the journal–since much of what I am discussing today focuses on their work. I should also acknowledge Matthew Lincoln, formerly the technical lead for the project, for the enormous labor he put into the technical infrastructure and workflows I’ll be discussing. And I also wanted to thank Jennifer Isasi, because the analytics I will mention came directly from her year-in-review blog post for the project.

By way of a roadmap – here’s what I’ll be discussing. After some brief background on the Programming Historian, I’ll discuss our editorial process and the technical platform, GitHub, we use to carry out those discussions and reviews. In particular, I’m going to highlight the costs and affordances of two aspects of it:

the slow, deliberate nature of working with the platform that enables translation and
the ways in which the platform force us to be extremely open and transparent.

And also, in case it’s useful for your ability to follow along with the talk, there is a link here to the rough text and slides of what I’ll be sharing.

Founded in 2008, The Programming Historian is a set of federated, open-access, and openly peer-reviewed journals that publishes novice-friendly articles on a range of different digital tools and workflows. The articles sit at the intersections of pedagogy and research. The idea is that someone who has, say, done work on network analysis with a particular corpus might then take that project and use it as a case study for a lesson with us that describes how others might perform network analysis themselves.
The project began by publishing in English and now includes 83 lessons in that language, but significant effort in recent years has been directed towards growing the project into other languages and for other communities. At this time of writing, the project contains 47 lessons in Spanish, 14 lessons in French, and a Portuguese version is soon to launch. We had 1.5 million visitors last year, but only about one third of those came from North America or the United Kingdom (more detailed analytics here). We work hard to think about this international audience. While the majority of our pieces right now originate in English, The Programming Historian has begun to receive original material in Spanish. And our goal is to accept original work in our other represented languages as well. A significant amount of the labor of the people on these project teams is directed to building the audience for their particular journals. Translating 80 lessons into a language like French is an enormous undertaking, and, in doing so, the editorial teams working in French aim to cultivate and engage with digital humanists working in that language who can then return to contribute their own original work.
But that is all subject for another talk. I have been on the English and technical teams for several years now, so I’m primarily going to be describing how we set up and facilitate the editorial processes that these non-English teams work through as they facilitate their massive translation projects.

Programming Historian began as an English-language publication, but now it is a set of journals with interlocking pieces. What I mean by that is that we have a set of journals that all share core architecture – general editorial guidelines, submission guidelines, and processes are shared among the journals. The public-facing pages for these components are all translated and kept in synch with one another if they change. These language-specific publications all use the same technical platform for submitting and reviewing work. But the translation projects are in various stages of completion, and the non-English journals are beginning to accept original lessons in their own languages. So core shared elements, but each journal acts independently according to their own timelines for production.

The primary thing I want to focus on today is how editorial activities intersect with technical platforms and the implications those technical choices, in turn, have for the identity, vision, and actions of the journals themselves. Parts of our process are quite familiar to other kinds of academic publishing workflows: we receive submissions by email, give editorial feedback upon accepting something for review, conduct open peer review, integrate feedback, etc. A few notable elements might be that we have a fairly turnaround from pitch to publication (six months to a year), we ask for pitches upfront rather than full manuscripts, and once we accept something into the review pipeline, we try to work generously with authors to see a piece to publication as much as we can. These pieces, in particular, are key to the vision of the project as we try to shape it.

These activities take place almost exclusively (save a few introductory emails) on a platform called GitHub. GitHub collects a suite of tools associated most closely with software development together, and I’ll go through a few that we’ve adapted for our editorial process along with the implications for doing so.

First, GitHub contains a suite of project management tools, and our peer review pipeline takes place in this system. In particular, we make heavy use of GitHub’s issue tracker for coordinating conversations about particular topics. Typical uses in the software management world for these tickets might be to collect information for acting on a bug report or gather conversation on a new feature. We lean on the conversational aspect of these tickets to manage our open peer review process. A new submission that has been accepted into the pipeline gets a new ticket that states where to find the lesson, shared expectations, and the editorial review of that piece takes place in public on this thread. Sometimes the public joins in unexpectedly, offering an unsolicited review or with words of encouragement about the new work. When we solicit reviews, they typically come in through this system. In addition to our review process, we handle 95% of internal conversations about the journal itself on this system which, again, periodically gets unexpected input from others outside the team. You can see here on the left an example review ticket on data normalization using pandas that I share with the author’s permission. On the right, you can see various editorial conversations about everything from bug reports to open debates about the identity of the project. They’re all happening in public.

A second aspect of the platform that we make substantial use of is GitHub’s file management system. GitHub makes use of Git, an extensive system for managing and resolving the changes made to files by groups of people. We actually use it for the work of managing the materials for our website itself. More on that in a second, but I first just wanted to give an example of what I mean by this sort of shared file management.
I imagine most people are probably more familiar with using Dropbox or Google Docs for collaborative authorship. Under those systems, the changes you make to documents are, usually, automatically synched. So, in this example, Fred or Lisa make changes to a shared Google Doc document that they can all see in real time. This is great in a lot of ways and has great implications for research and teaching, but it also has drawbacks. We’ve all been editing a Google Doc with a group of people when someone makes a huge change, shifting everything out of order. Not a big deal when you’re editing text, but when working with software you have to be more delicate about collaborating on your files. What distinguishes GitHub is that it is optimized for comparing changes on a line-by-line level. Rather than synching changes automatically, each part of the process – saving a change, sending it up to the cloud, retrieving someone else’s changes – requires its own command. So you can imagine how this process becomes much slower and more tied to each person’s identity. We can more easily pull apart the changes made by Lisa from those made by Dave. And when Dave inevitably messes up the project we could isolate his problematic changes and remove them. This core idea of shared editing in a slow, deliberate manner is something most of us regularly engage with. But because GitHub breaks out this editing process into so many steps (and adds an esoteric layer of vocabulary to each part of the process), the system is often very confusing for people.

GitHub is typically used for software development, so I wanted to start with an example of using it for just that. Before you is a typical example of what a change to a file looks like in GitHub’s interface for viewing them. GitHub calls this change a “commit,” and you’re looking at a representation of that change’s differences (a “diff”). This is from an old project of mine doing text analysis on punctuation in Virginia Woolf. I had found that the particular way I was searching for quotation marks wasn’t quite right, so I updated it. Looking at this diff briefly, GitHub makes it clear what I changed. Changes in red mean a line was subtracted, green means a line was added. So, you can see at a glance what was changed without having to do much visual collation on your own and without needing to be familiar with the project.

Here’s another example. On the Scholars’ Lab website we made a change to the markup for our blog, the information that tells your web browser how to display the site to visitors. Here we change, among other things, the phrase “who we are” to “what we do.” I bring up this example, in particular, because it moves in the direction of the kind of work we do as digital humanists. Digital projects represent a great deal of intellectual work, and that labor becomes bound up in the technical processes with which we carry them out. Here, the process by which we describe the lab for the web here is visible alongside the technical architecture for it. The self-formulation, the writing, is a part of GitHub. And it happens in public.

Here is one last series of diffs that I wanted to show from the Programming Historian’s presence on GitHub. We take advantage of this slow, belabored way of making changes as a means of facilitating translation work for the site. Lessons are translated in whole units. But I mentioned that we have core architecture for each journal that we want to stay relatively in synch. This is made complicated as the process by which we do things is constantly evolving. In the past few years, we have shared new guidelines for how to write sustainably, advice for how to write with an international audience in mind, and numerous changes to our submission process. Each of these changes has text that needs to be translated across the different language editions, and we want to make sure that things are current and not in various stages of completion. So, we use GitHub’s system to coordinate our efforts. What you see here is a change we are currently making to our editorial guidelines. I offer the new text for the change in English, flag the changes using GitHub’s system, and then the language teams use this interface to coordinate and manage the translation process. So here a few paragraphs get offered in English on the left, translated to French in the top-right diff, and translated to Portuguese in the bottom-right.

This process has several effects on our work. First, it means that any changes we make to our public-facing documents take a while to implement, because we make sure that all our public-facing changes almost always go into effect in all languages at once. Second and more importantly, this process has been especially useful for making the English team aware of the labor of translation. Any change we want to propose has ripple effects for the other teams downstream, so it helps to surface the human cost of tinkering with process. The English-language team is not the only one offering changes to the process that requires such work, but, perhaps because we have been working longest, I think we tend to be the most frequent culprits.
When it comes to our core site documents, we think of translation as a key part of our process that happens on an ongoing basis rather than something that happens after the fact. Besides the logistics of the process, this also raises the visibility and legibility of translation and internationalization as key parts of our process. The non-English language teams have done extraordinary work to ensure that we think of lessons that come into our pipeline as being bound for an international audience rather than solely as meant to live in a single language. Because of the advocacy and input of these teams, the project developed some guidelines for authors and editors on avoiding regionally specific language and ways to think about how to best structure a lesson for an international audience. And we’ve been discussing internally about whether some DH methods might be less translatable at their core and the implications this might have. All of this is to say that in terms of process and even down to technical architecture, we’ve been working hard in recent years to transition away from an English-first approach to editorial work and towards one that encourages many points of entry, with English just serving as one potential path in.

Another result of carrying out our work on GitHub is that the platform is heavily biased towards open. The project is as well. Our peer review and our technical architecture are public, but we’ve embraced this ethos to hold most of our editorial conversations in the open, meaning our churning is out there for anyone to see (or join in on!). Just as a few examples, on the top-right here is a screenshot of the conversation thread that lead to our sustainability guidelines. The other two conversations relate to ongoing efforts to make our editorial board, our authors, and our reviewers more diverse and friendlier to participants of a variety of genders. This work is far from finished. If you look at these threads and others, the project is frequently taken to task – internally and externally – for ways in which we can be better. In the same way that our lessons are openly peer reviewed, you might say that the journals themselves are constantly under open review. We’re in a perpetual state of revise and resubmit.

I also wanted to offer a few thoughts on the costs of this way of working. As I mentioned, we can move quickly in some ways but are quite slow in others. Our rolling deadline and quick publishing timeline make us quite quick by academic standards. But making changes to the underlying architecture and documentation of that editorial process, as evinced by the translation diffs I showed you, is an extremely slow and deliberative process. As I hope I have made clear, I actually think this is a very good thing, in that it helps us to think beyond a single language, makes more visible the labor that goes into translation, and increases collaboration across teams working in specific languages. But it should still be noted as an effect of the technical choices we have made.
Second, there are limits to how you can ethically carry out an open peer review process. No matter how much encouragement you give to people to be positive and generous in their readings, sometimes you get reviewers who are blunt or cruel. And no matter how much you work with an author, sometimes a work is not quite to a stage where it can be published. In situations like these, authors need the ability to opt their work and its review history out of the open – the stakes of such things for early-career scholars are just too high. Because we’re so tightly integrated with GitHub, which prioritizes openness and exhaustive record-keeping, it can be difficult to truly wipe something from the project history. It can be done, but doing so is a tad difficult because it works a bit at cross purposes to being on GitHub in the first place. So this bias towards an open archive is one caution I would offer to those considering carrying out editorial work in an environment like this.
One last thing I would note is that carrying out editorial process through GitHub is difficult and complicated. It requires a fair degree of technical fluency that most editors (and some authors) do not have when they come to work with us for the first time. Matthew Lincoln, who I mentioned early on, did an extraordinary job documenting in exhaustive detail how to work in this system, and we still regularly have issues. This is a common issue with “minimal computing” approaches to doing digital work, of which our project is an example. Our site uses a classic minimal computing stack – a Jekyll project coordinated and deployed through GitHub. This means that, from a technical standpoint, our work is more sustainable and requests less computing power for visitors. It also means that we’re pretty tightly in control of much of our publishing process and can change the look and feel of the project ourselves. But the cost is that we ask quite a lot of our editors to engage with the system, and it takes a lot of careful collaboration, assistance, and pair programming to make sure people are able to contribute.

If I haven’t scared you off with my last slide, I wanted to close with a resource in case you’re interested in learning more about how to implement this kind of pipeline on your own. The process for collaborative authorship I described here need not only apply to peer review journals. I mentioned that we applied a version of this system to the Scholars’ Lab blog, and I published a piece in the Programming Historian with Amanda Visconti and the Scholars’ Lab community that documents this process. We don’t cover how to internationalize your work and facilitate its translation. Lincoln has published a great blog post on how the Programming Historian does this piece in particular. But we do cover how to take a site meant for one person and turn it into a multi-author site with a pipeline for collaborative peer review. So, if you’re interested in setting up your own collaborative publishing space for a team you’re involved with you might check out that link.
That’s it for me – thank you very much!
Addendum: I got one question during the Q&A about how to convince other people to adopt this sort of stack for their own work. My response was to lean on the “costs” slide that I offered towards the end of the talk. Rather than assuming everyone needs to develop a pipeline like this in GitHub, I think any project team needs to look at their needs and the abilities of their group before committing to a system like this. To a large degree, this decision becomes a question of where your team wants to invest their energy. For some, that might very well be the kind of minimal computing setup we have here. For others, WordPress might make more sense. Our Programming Historian article has a short section on how to diagnose these needs and think about the costs and benefits of each.

The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2021-2022 academic year is Monday, February 15th, 2021. More details on how to apply at the end of this page.
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2021-2022 cohort - January 19th, 2021 from 2:00-3:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. You are, of course, welcome to write to Brandon Walsh separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application so that you can get working.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in the fall.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1 The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both Brandon Walsh and their program director prior to applying.
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;
a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;
a short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue;
and, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.


a dissertation abstract (no more than one page);
2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation;
and your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot, either on Wednesday, February 24th from 9-12 or 3-4 or on Thursday, February 25th from 9-11. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to express their interest and (once an application has been submitted) to let us know you have applied. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with this fellowship or otherwise.



Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award. ↩

Calling UVA graduate students! We’re still thinking about 2020, but it’s never too early to think about next year. Applications are now open for the 2021-2022 Praxis Program cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2021. Consider spending some time with us next year!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2021-2022 cohort - February 2nd, 2021 from 2:00-3:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Recent projects include Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA’s real estate development since the 1980’s, and a project on critical approaches to DH education.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to Brandon Walsh to discuss their eligibility.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;
and your availability on the day and times we’ve identified for interviews - March 22nd 2-4; March 23rd 10-2; or March 24th 10-11. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

The best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.
Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due March 1st and can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

Back in January, we in the Scholars’ Lab looked back fondly on all the public writing we had done together in 2019 and boldly looked ahead to all that we would do in 2020. We had big plans for putting more thoughts out in the world on a variety of topics. Then, of course, 2020 happened. In addition to the ongoing public health emergency, I have also been simmering with bottled rage about the full spectrum of political struggles related to the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, the ongoing climate emergency, and the Presidential election. Writing seems far less important now, with everything going on. All of this is to say that I, for one, have not been getting much blogging done. I felt a tremendous amount of guilt around this at first, as one typically does in academia when you have publicly declared yourself to be doing something that you cannot follow through on. But I have been trying to take the advice of Connor Kenaston, a former Praxis student, who advised his cohort at the beginnings of the pandemic to “be gentle with yourself.”
My version of being gentle has involved accepting that now is not the time to worry about putting new ideas into the world. When I had my comprehensive exams during my PhD, my advisor described graduate school to that point as a period of taking information in, as opposed to the new phase I was entering that would redirect that effort outwards as I looked towards the dissertation. Though of course it could be more nuanced, I think there is some truth to that binary: never before or since have I ever read as voraciously as I did during my graduate coursework and while studying for my exams. In the present moment I’ve found myself going backwards in a good way. While I have not been in a mental space conducive to writing, I have been trying to make more time for quiet reflection as I can. I have struggled in the last nine months to understand everything that is going on, in part because it defies easy explanation. I have been turning to others wiser than I am for guidance about how to respond to the ongoing emergencies in my own work, particularly as a means of trying to learn more about the struggles of students and colleagues whose experiences are different than mine. I’ve been spending more time reading, and I wanted to share a few things I have found especially useful.
On Financial Aid
I’ve written before that your perspective on what it currently is like to be a student is, fundamentally, going to be different from reality unless you are currently a student. And this gulf will deepen the further you age away from your own time as an enrolled student. I have my own experiences with student debt, but I wanted to read more about how students currently experience the financial aid process and its associated burdens. To that end, I read a significant chunk of Sara Goldrick-Rab’s Paying the Price: College Costs, Financial Aid, and the Betrayal of the American Dream. The book is exceptional in a number of ways, both for providing clear data that is helpful for informing conversations about student aid and debt as well as for the specific interviews that it offers drawn from students currently living through the process. Most helpful for me was the material that describes exactly how student aid (and, by association, debt) is calculated by financial aid offices. It is wildly more complicated than I ever could have imagined, and reading Goldrick-Rab’s work has helped give me a better understanding of the intersectional context for the student debt crisis and how it extends into graduate education.
On Food Scarcity
The pandemic has, in many ways, drawn attention to system inequalities already in place across the globe. The closure of schools has exacerbated food scarcity among those K-12 students who rely on school lunches. Goldrick-Rab’s work with the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice does an excellent job of showing just how much on food scarcity continues to be an issue for higher education. A useful piece that summarizes some of the issues is “It’s hard to study if you’re hungry.” A more pointed line that has been kicking around in my head since reading that piece is “it’s impossible to learn when you’re starving.”
On Loving Your Job
Katina Rogers recently published Putting the Humanities PhD to Work, a book I found incredibly useful on a broad range of topics related to graduate pedagogy and advising. I found her description of love as it pertains to one’s work especially useful: “the notion that one work’s ‘for love’ reflects a position of privilege that minimizes the struggle many academics face to support themselves, and renders invisible the barriers that exacerbate the challenges for women, people of color, people with disabilities, and others who are not well supported by the structures of academe” (22). The same description, of course, could work for a number of different careers, but that should not diminish the critique’s power as it pertains to higher education.
On Precarious Labor
I’ve been finding it helpful to read about labor advocacy, both in digital humanities and otherwise, as a way of understanding how the pandemic has exacerbated the economic and power disparities that have always existed in the university structure. Precarious Labor in the Digital Humanities by Christina Boyles, Anne Cong-Huyen, Carrie Johnston, Jim McGrath, and Amanda Phillips is an excellent way in for those of us working digital humanities. In addition, the coverage of the University of Michigan graduate students and RAs strike over their administration’s response to COVID-19 has been instructive for the kind of solidarity and activism that our current moment calls for.
On Student Surveillance
It feels like we all live on Zoom now, and I am very grateful to those who have drawn attention to the insidious effects of video technology used for pedagogy on student privacy. Asking students to turn their video on during a call, for example, can involve inviting a student’s instructor and peers into their private economic and social circumstances in ways that can be harmful. Shea Swauger, writing on the related issue of algorithmic test proctoring, argues that “Cheating is not a technological problem, but a social and pedagogical problem. Technology is often blamed for creating the conditions in which cheating proliferates and is then offered as the solution to the problem it created; both claims are false.” I especially appreciated the ways in which Swauger ties technological solutions to online cheating as ultimately encoding a eugenic gaze into the classroom. Zoom often feels like something I just switch on as a part of starting my working day, but pieces like this have been helpful for thinking through the pedagogical and ethical implications of it and related platforms.
There’s no clear sign that we’re getting back to normal anytime soon, and I’m grateful to these authors for the guidance they offer for navigating our current circumstances. They’ve made me a better teacher and colleague.

When I studied music in school, we were all given a listening placement test. First, the graduate student in charge would play a series of melodies and harmonies for us, and we were asked to notate them. The second test exercised the inverse skills: given a sheet of music we were asked to sing what we saw in front of us. In each case, we were graded on how accurately we were able to convert sound to written notation and back again. All incoming music majors were slotted into one of six sections based on the results of our ear training test, and I placed into the bottom one. Even the most basic skill–pitch matching, or the ability to hear a note and sing that same note back–was a challenge for me. Twice a week for the rest of the semester, the students in my section filed into a basement classroom and made noise around a piano in what must have been an excruciating experience for the trained music doctoral student who taught us.
Over the course of the year, that teacher worked with us to develop “big ears.” This term refers to a number of overlapping concepts from the music industry that, together, represent an exceptionally strong attention to the nuances of musicmaking and the collaborations required for performance. Ashley Capps, organizer of the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tennessee, described it in this way: “The term ‘big ears’ is also slang in the music industry that describes being an especially acute and perceptive listener […] So, a great sound engineer, a DJ who has an affinity for picking hit songs or simply someone who listens broadly and deeply—they’re all said to have big ears.” I’ve heard the term a few times over the years. Most recently, on The Musician’s Guide to Being Healthy, Wealthy & Wise, a podcast about the music industry, it was used to describe a performer who was especially strong at perceiving what others were playing. In that context, it was specifically used to refer to someone with strong aural skills, a term that refers to the ability to hear pitch, harmony, intervals, melodies, and similar characteristics of music and identify them based solely or primarily on hearing.
Listening in this way—with big ears—is challenging, but it is a skill that can be learned. Each semester as a music student, I had to take a version of that same ear training placement test. Each time I got a lot wrong, but the care and attention of the instructors helped me, over time, to get a little more right. By my sixth semester I made it into the fifth section—not quite the top group of students but close! My last undergraduate semester involved singing a lot of Bach chorales twice a week each morning. I am still far from the best, but I continue to improve to this day. I don’t have a musicianship class anymore, but I do have an app for my phone that helps me to keep practicing. You can always get better at listening.
This is one of my favorite stories about learning because it takes something that appears magical and wholly out of reach and shows that, with time and practice, it is a skill that can be developed by anyone. It’s also a story, I think, about teaching. How easy would it have been for my instructor to belittle me as I struggled to get started with singing? Instead, my teacher listened—however hard that might have been for them. The story feels especially relevant for the present moment, because it’s fundamentally about how those in power do or do not listen to those in their care.
It feels impossible to work right now, let alone teach, when so many people are barely holding families, institutions, and themselves together. How can we work with students under these conditions, when it feels, so often, as though the important voices of those doing the work go unheard? The students and staff that inhabit our educational spaces, that maintain them, and that labor in them are struggling through catastrophe. We are bodies, dealing with the physical and emotional strain of a public health emergency. Now, more than ever, the work of the classroom requires careful attention and, I think, a pedagogy of radical empathy. A renewed focus on intentional and purposeful listening, even—and especially—as it is devalued around us.
When we moved online this spring, I, like many instructors, struggled to transition my work to an entirely virtual format. But I also knew it was entirely necessary. My students in the Praxis Program were in the thick of shaping what their developing project would look like and how to implement it. When the students and I were able to touch base in our first online Zoom meeting, I made one thing clear: their well-being came first. Even if the students produced no final project as originally planned, that was perfectly acceptable. They were already successes to us. Then, I asked them to take some time to think together about what they wanted to do as a team. These were not empty promises: I was prepared to fully back up whatever choice the students made.
In a number ways, our ability to focus heavily on students’ well-being was enabled by privilege. Because the Scholars’ Lab operates a fellowship program from the library, I don’t have to give grades and the outcomes can be quite flexible. There are, however, a range of thinkers in critical digital pedagogy, including Jesse Stommel and Sean Michael Morris, who have written eloquently on how such choices are good, ethical pedagogy that can and should be explored by all teachers such as they are able. Other critics, too, have talked about the importance of empathetic attention to students’ needs during the present moment. Pedagogy and American Literary Studies has suggested that you might not need that absence policy right now. Michelle Pacansky-Brock has offered a model survey for checking on your students’ needs during this difficult time. Matthew Cheney and Catherine Denial have each argued for modifying our syllabi and our pedagogies to be founded on kindness rather than abuse. There are many more ideas in circulation, and the ones that most resonate with me are those that accommodate the urgent and pressing needs of others, of those students and collaborators who are caring for children, lack access to broadband internet, or are worried for loved ones.
When we resumed meetings, it was clear that the students wanted to forge ahead and complete their project, but we also recognized that the nature of the community had changed. I think by offering the possibility of an extreme (though, in my view, ethical) response to the pandemic, they, an already cohesive and close group, became even more caring for one another. For the rest of the semester, we had regular check-ins, individually and collectively on personal well-being. We cared for each other as people even as the work carried forward. The project resulted in Land and Legacy, an incisive look at the University of Virginia’s and the University of Virginia Foundation’s land expansion in Charlottesville and Albemarle County since the 1980s.
For me, these ideas are part of a broad pedagogy of deep listening—that is, of hearing students’ needs as both thinkers and people and structuring a learning environment to accommodate them. Listening in this way is not passive. Instead, it borrows from musicians, for whom listening is always a process of attention and response. In their collection entitled, appropriately enough, Big Ears: Listening for Gender in Jazz Studies Nichole T. Rustin and Sherrie Tucker quote Ingrid Monson on listening: “[jazz musicians] mean it in a very active sense: they must listen closely because they are continually called upon to respond to and participate in an ongoing flow of musical action that can change or surprise them at any moment” (1). Listening—real listening—is about careful attention to the whole, your part in the collective, and how you can grow together. Sometimes that means staying silent. Sometimes that means making noise. It always means paying attention to what the group needs.
Listening, in these terms, is the action by which the collective forms itself. Whether teaching in-person, hybrid, or online this fall, whether talking about the classroom, the administrative planning meeting, or the ballot box in November: voices are likely to be silenced. Committing to listening does not mean inaction in the face of these oppressive systems. Sean Michael Morris gets at a similar point in “Not Enough Voices,” when he discusses his own anxiety over speaking too much: “The answer doesn’t lie in turn-taking, but in changing what it means to speak. Make speaking a collaborative event. Join your voice with the voice of students. Join your voice with the voice of other teachers.” In these terms, a pedagogy of listening is one that attends to voices, one that helps make space for equitable terms of engagement. This sense of listening, one that is born of and that leads to collective action, is something we need now more than ever. Right now, we need teachers and administrators who are ready to listen, to make space, and to speak up. To hear, echo, and amplify the voices of their students.
There is much more to say about pedagogies of listening. For now I will end with one last quote, this one from Igor Stravinsky: “To listen is an effort, and just to hear is no merit. A duck hears also.” Don’t be a duck. People aren’t born good at listening. Teaching with big ears is a skill you can practice, and there’s no better time than the present.

We are thrilled to announce the 2020-2021 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 8 fellows from 6 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past students!
Praxis Program
We are delighted to welcome 6 team members to the 10th (!) year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:

Grace Alvino, English

Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities
Finally, we are looking forward to working with Janet Dunkelbarger and Michelle Morgenstern, our 2020-2021 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.

Janet S. Dunkelbarger’s (Art and Architectural History) dissertation is titled “The Garden Dining Spaces of Pompeii: An Archaeological Assessment”
Michelle Morgenstern’s (Anthropology) dissertation is titled “Play, Purity, & Social Justice: The Poetics of Ethical Discourse in Digital Space”

These fellows will work with our team throughout the year and over the summer on substantial research projects related to their dissertations. They join a vibrant community of students working in the lab in the coming year as Makerspace Technologists, Cultural Heritage Interns, GIS Technicians, and more.
Special thanks to everyone who served on the application committees that selected these fantastic students. We are looking forward to working with all of them in the coming year!

I finished drafting this post back before the extent of the coronavirus pandemic was becoming known. And now, of course, the impact of the virus around the globe—and on higher education in particular—continues to evolve. So I had been sitting on this post for some time; I wasn’t sure how a rapidly changing landscape of higher education, replete with hiring freezes and bleak budgetary outlooks, might impact these conversations. I’m still uncertain. But I’m publishing this now in the expectation that ethical conversations about budgets as they pertain to students and teaching are likely to become more important now than ever. I’m grateful to Mackenzie Brooks, Amanda Visconti, and Elizabeth Fox for reading the post over.
Caveats aside—this post is part of a larger project I’m working on over the course of the year about the intersections of digital humanities pedagogy as it can reflect and enact infrastructural change in higher education. While each post is meant to stand on its own, they do participate in a longer conversation. It might be helpful to explore the framing post for the series for context.
I will talk elsewhere about opportunities for pedagogical interventions in the context of credit-bearing courses. For now, I wanted to speak primarily from my own institutional perspective. As the Head of Student Programs for a library-based center for digital research, the teaching that I do tends not to happen in for-credit courses. Instead, my teaching takes place in a range of activities: year-long student fellowships that carry a stipend that I design and administer in collaboration with the rest of the Scholars’ Lab, one-on-one consultations, one-off workshops, and more. Roughly half of my working life is spent on the actual work of theorizing and carrying out teaching. The other half is spent on developing the administrative infrastructure to allow such work to happen, for myself and others. With that in mind, I wanted to pause over the kinds of pedagogical interventions that can be made by people in these kinds of positions—whether we describe them as alt-academic, para-academic, academic, or otherwise. For that reason, the following does not apply so much to teaching in credit bearing courses, though it might offer useful food for thought as it applies to a range of pedagogical situations.
Sean Michael Morris refers to a pedagogical habitus, “embodied practice, often uninspected or subterranean to a person’s own thinking about themselves,” that forms the “genetic makeup” of an instructor’s teaching. In this line of thought, pedagogy is not just a practice–it is more properly thought of as your general attitude towards the work of teaching that you do. Put simply, your pedagogy is reflected in every action you take that could potentially affect students and your attitudes towards all such actions. It’s not too much of an exaggeration, I think, to say that with this frame of thinking every action can be considered a pedagogical one. No administrative decision is too small to affect students in some way.
I often point to budgets as the clearest example of how mundane administrative details, seemingly disconnected from the work of the classroom, have profound ramifications for teachers and learners. To put the finest point on it: your budget is a pedagogical issue. It’s also a question of equity. The economic circumstances your program creates or participates in directly affect the kinds of people able to participate in your programs and the work they can do.
Higher education is a time of enormous financial uncertainty for many students. Sara Goldrick-Rab’s work with #realcollege, for example, has brought attention to the number of college students that struggle with food and housing insecurity. The situation is often no better for graduate students who, even if their programs offer tuition remission and stipends, are frequently forced to live in poverty. B. Mano’s piece on their particular circumstances at MIT sheds light, in particular, on how specific institutional policies can intersect with national labor and immigration law to produce especially dire situations for students. In these circumstances, any decision that we make as administrators can have dire consequences for the lives of the students around us.
Of course, every situation is different and subject to different pressures. Many institutions doing digital work simply don’t have any budget or funding at all. If you’re in a position like this, it might feel difficult to imagine how you could structure financial circumstances for your students in a more equitable manner when you’re still trying to find any kind of firm structure at all. In what follows I don’t mean to propose the perfect as the enemy of the good. Instead, I’d suggest taking the following as opportunities to examine where you’re at in the hopes of finding a way towards better outcomes—whatever “better” means for you and your circumstances. At the very least, I hope that the following discussion can supply resources and questions to use as we all try to advocate for better labor conditions for students.
Four pedagogical questions that you might ask of the student side of your budget are:

Does it exist?
Is it stable?
Is it transparent?
Is it what my students need?

Does it exist?
Are students a part of your budget? If not, why? In Elissa Frankle’s ignite talk entitled “Pay Your F-ing Interns,” she describes how unpaid internships reinforce whiteness and homogenous, privileged communities in museum workers. Frankle goes on: “We may say that we value diversity, that of course we want to treat our workers well, but do our core documents and budgets reflect that fact?” Our decisions about infrastructure, at their best, should reflect what our organizations believe in. A first useful question you can ask of your budget, then, is, whether and to what degree your work with students rises to the level of budget lines and conversations during allocations.
What you can pay is, of course, a local issue. But it is worth questioning whether your current payment practices are the result of habit or limitations. At UVA, we are subject to a range of policies that impact what we can offer students. It’s important to know what these are at your institution so that you can answer statements like “we can only pay X” with “actually, the policy states we can pay X+Y.” I often find state and local policies as a useful first tool when advocating for students, and they can also provide common language for working with financial administrators elsewhere in your institution who might be more removed from the day-to-day lives of your students.
Even if you’re not instituting something as formal as an internship or an hourly position, it’s worth considering how much unpaid time you’re asking of your students. Asking students to drive visiting speakers to events, for example, might appear negligible for the amount of effort it requires. But this small ask still takes a student’s time, time that they could be applying to their own work, to another paid position, or to personal needs.
In short, recognize the economic impact you are likely already having on students and decide whether you can do better. Recognize what you ask of them, first, and second ask what you can pay them.
Is it stable?
Students need to be able to plan their finances. If they cannot, only students from affluent backgrounds will be able to make decisions about their educations in the face of such uncertainty. If we want to design programs for students that will be as inclusive as possible, we need to strive for better stability in what we can offer. I am well aware that stable budgets are a luxury in most institutions, including my own. This is especially true in digital humanities, where people and organizations have successfully lobbied IMLS, CLIR, the Mellon Foundation, and the NEH ODH for substantial grants to support their work.
Grant funding can provide valuable experience for students and resources for paying them for their labor. And at some institutions these avenues might be the only ones available for funding the work of you and your students. Grants come with the disadvantage, of course, that they will eventually run their course. Soft money can provide useful supplemental resources for employing students, but the associated instability can cause long-term issues for students and staff. For example, a term-limited grant-funded student position might be listed as one year with year extension contingent on successful performance. In such a situation, the student or postdoctoral worker will spend a significant portion of their time planning and searching for what comes next when the grant-funded position ends. Extensions to a contracted position might, of course, be more dependent on successful lobbying for continued funding than on faith in an already carefully vetted candidate. But it’s still worth considering the real-life ramifications these positions can have for candidates.
It is worth noting the benefits of stable student programs founded on hard money. Through a combination of advocacy and strategic planning, the Lab has been fortunate enough to offer two stable fellowships for several years now. Praxis is completing its ninth year, and our Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is in its thirteenth year. This means that students can plan on these programs as possibilities for them as they plot out not just their research agenda during their time with us, but also their plans for applying for supplemental funding. It is truly unfortunate that we cannot accept everyone who applies, but we work hard to try to bring as many people as we can into our community. It takes time for research agendas to develop, and students need time to decide if such things are right for them. The Scholars’ Lab has application cycles that run virtually all year long for its various programs, and students discuss their intention to apply well in advance of when they are eligible to do so.
Stable programs lead to better support for students as well. Supporting students requires time and energy from staff, no matter how experienced and skilled they might be. Thoughtful and considerate planning that includes student support as part of the regular workload for staff ensures that teaching and pedagogy will not become afterthoughts. Even if suddenly presented with the financial option to take on new students, one should ask if they can be supported.
Good teaching follows from well-supported and energized staff who are empowered to decide if they have the bandwidth to take on new students. Good learning follows from students who can make informed decisions about their lives and have the time and space to commit to learning.
Is it transparent?
I often find that students have received no real information about the systems by which their finances get processed. On the one hand, this is understandable—university budgeting processes are byzantine, and information about payment processing might seem like a means to an end and less crucial to students’ day-to-day lives. But providing knowledge about these systems can help students plan their own lives more capably. I have found it helpful to make sure students are aware of a range of different components related to how their payments are processed:

University payroll calendars
The length of time it takes for a payment to process
Whether a payment will be taxed up front or not
Whether a certain amount of payment during the year triggers automatic taxation
When payments are likely to come through, how often, and in what amount

Each of these elements can help students plan their time and finances. In addition, I’ve found that it can be difficult for us to track when something goes wrong in a payment that we’ve issued. We know when we issue it, and we find out if a student gets their funds. But there are many steps along the way. With many, many links in the administrative chain before the money actually gets dispersed to students, there are many places where things could go wrong. So I have regular appointments on my calendar when I ask students to make sure that they’ve been paid as expected. I often find students are really patient and willing to wait even if it appears that something might be amiss. But, as payments take time to process, I would rather we be in constant communication and transparent about where things stand so that we can reduce the burden on students already living in states of financial precarity. A transparent budgeting and dispersal process is a more ethical one.
Is it what they need?
Lastly, any administrative process can be enhanced by student input. As is often the case with teaching, I find the best way to grow is to ask students for their insights. Put simply, unless you were a student very recently, you probably do not know what sorts of pressures your students are subject to. Unless you recently lived paycheck to paycheck, it might be easy to forget the sort of financial precarity that a number of our students live under. And it is impossible for any one person to have personal experience that tracks with every possible student experience in the world. In short, be wary of invoking Students with a capital ‘s’, as one broad monolithic community. In order to take a broad, intersectional approach to your teaching and administration, you must talk with students themselves. They are experts on their own situations, and talking with your students about their needs can help to inform your decisions. They’ll learn more about how the university works, and the teaching and pedagogy you can offer will be enhanced as it more closely matches the real-world experiences of your community.
We address this same point in the Scholars’ Lab Student Programs Charter:

We teach in public, meaning that we talk openly about our pedagogical process. When possible, we write about it as well. If something is not working, we will change it and adapt based on the needs of the students and our colleagues. Accordingly, we expect our students to talk and write about their work and the learning process for them, to engage in the experience, and help us shape a pedagogical experience that works for them.

To engage your students directly in conversations like those above is to treat them as peers, as collaborators in the learning process in all of its messiness. Details like these might seem removed from teaching or overly specific. But they have material effects on the day-to-live lives of your student collaborators. A conversation with a student about how the uncertainties around a particular fellowship payment, for example, helped us to understand that a different distribution calendar would offer students more cushion if payments were delayed. We wouldn’t have gotten the idea had we not talked with the student directly about their needs.
As mentioned above, it can be difficult to balance these conversations against the realities of trying to do this work. We don’t live in a perfect world, and we’re all working with limited resources. Talking with students directly can be a way of sussing out whether your budgetary situation is operating for them and their lives and how it might work better for them. Students can help us all find our way to more equitable pedagogies and budgets that reflect them. You cannot do everything, but you might be able to adjust a few things. In the current climate of higher education, when many are faced with hiring freezes, across-the-board budget cuts, the prospect of layoffs, and withdrawn job offers, such conversations might seem small. But small decisions can matter in big ways for your students. And they can help us care for our vulnerable community members during chaotic times.

Amanda, Ammon, and I have been discussing our plans for the upcoming year of blogging. While last year’s blogging push was invigorating and exciting, we wanted things to be slightly different in the coming year. In particular, we’ve been talking about wanting more continuity in the things we publish. Speaking for myself, it often felt like I was blogging just in time and on deadline. Some good things came out of that work, but I liked the idea of putting just a little more thinking into the project ahead of time so that I could blog around a central topic for the year. Amanda and Ammon have been incredibly helpful in talking about all this with me.
Truthfully, I’ve been feeling the lack of a large writing project lately. After my dissertation, I worked on a text analysis coursebook with Sarah Horowitz, a faculty colleague at W&L. I adore blogging, but I feel the lure of a large project I can chip away at over the next year and that can draw together my energy. Am I talking about writing a book? Maybe? We’ll see. I’m certainly not the first person to write a book in public, but the idea of revealing what I was aiming for made me feel a little uneasy. What if my ideas didn’t cohere (I tend to write in multiple sections of a project at once)? What if I didn’t actually produce anything or finish? What if the project turned out to be empty (easier to dismiss a single blog post)? Does what I’m interested in working on even need to be a book? What do I mean by book - is it a published thing with a press or just something big that lives online?
I had initially planned on just quietly blogging around a cluster of ideas over the next year and then potentially revealing at the end that they were part of a coherent project in progress. But as I started to write the first post on imposter syndrome (seriously)- and in the midst of talking with my students about the very topic - I thought I should put my money where my mouth is from the outset. So here you go! Here are my notes on the large, ongoing, multifaceted writing project that I’ll be trying to cohere together over the course of the next year. If it winds up being something I try to actually turn into a book so be it. If it just winds up being a series of blog posts, then I’ll at least be happy to have written about topics I felt were urgent.
One last note on process: in my PhD program we did an activity where we repeatedly drafted a fantasy table of contents for our dissertation. No abstracts necessary at that stage - just a title for the project and titles for the chapters. I found it enormously useful as a means for thinking through the different shapes a large writing project could take. That’s essentially what I do below. I try on a provisional title for the large project and take a spin at some rough chapter ideas. Since this is a blogging endeavor to begin with, within each chapter title I offer some titles, topics, or questions for blog posts that might intersect with it. I flag a few thinkers and discourses that I see this all drawing upon and engaging with. I also offer a few beginning thoughts towards a topic (nothing surprising, if you’ve read other posts by me on here). My arguments always tend to emerge in the process of writing, though, so it will be interesting to see how this develops over the course of a year. So take this for what it is - a sketch of a sketch of things I find urgent and will be trying to attend to over the coming months. Stay tuned for a look into my messy process.
I thought I might start by close reading this provisional, draft-y title as a way of getting at the ideas I want to explore. For now, at least, I’m thinking about it as called Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind.
Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind

Our pedagogy model and reflect the kind of academic community we want to see in the  world. Academia is toxic in numerous ways. Teaching and the ways we theorize and practice it can be interventions in the culture around us. The project hopes to connect classroom practice broadly construed with the kinds of infrastructural changes they reflect and enact.
Kindness is at the core of the project. I’m trying to formulate a theory of DH pedagogy that is, at its core, one about developing a less toxic and more affirmative space for students in higher education. It’s about developing empathy and kindness as teachers and how DH can (or cannot?) offer us the space to do so within and against the infrastructures of academia.
Finally, at least in this title, I wanted to get at the idea of paying a debt in goods and services rather than in cash. For starters, I like this formulation because it draws in a range of topics. What do we owe our students? It raises the specter of student debt. And it draws in Paulo Freire and questions of neoliberal, zero-sum teaching. Is digital humanities fundamentally bound up in neoliberal politics of the university? Yes. How can we develop an ethical, just, and progressive pedagogy anyway and in the face of this?

A starting list of thinkers I imagine the project in dialogue with: Cathy Davidson, Katina Rogers, Kathleen Fitzpatrick, Jeremy Boggs and Purdom Lindblad, Hannah Alpert-Abrams, Amanda Henrichs, Roopika Risam, Sara Goldrick-Rab; Jesse Stommel and Sean Michael Morris, Matthew Cheney, Catherine Denial, bell hooks, Paulo Freire; Shawn Graham; Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers; Brian Croxall; Carolina Villarroel, Gabriela Baeza Ventura, Trevor Muñoz (and more). Significant projects that I’d examine and reflect on would include the UCLA Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights, the Collaborators Bill of Rights, The Futures Initiative, HASTAC, Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities,  ILiADS, #generousthinking, The Postdoctoral Laborers Bill of Rights, the Academic Job Market Support Network, AADHum, and USLDH, among others. In my mind I want to tie together questions of higher education reform, critical digital pedagogy, and DH pedagogy. I’m certain I’m leaving people and projects out in this short and initial list - such is the nature of blogging about a work in progress. I’ll be working on a Zotero bibliography that collects these resources for myself and others as I continue reading around about the important work already being done in these areas.
I imagine the project offering a theory and praxis of DH teaching and pedagogy - very broadly construed, as it tries to develop a theory of pedagogy far beyond the classroom -  as an intervention in academic culture. DH pedagogy offers a number of great interventions to begin with – meditations on failure, teaching as activism, rethinking the professional futures of humanities students – and I’d like to join those conversations with others from critical digital pedagogy that emphasize radically student-centered teaching. With these frameworks, I’ll focus the work on the conditions of being a DH student – the material labor and working circumstances, the conditions of professional development and career prospects, the intersections of administrative decisions and the economic conditions of student life. I think doing so will help to give a better sense of the lives at the core of DH pedagogy as they intersect with the administrative infrastructures of DH. And perhaps ultimately the project aims to argue for a pedagogy that teaches with and alongside students and with kindness that happens together (a lot of echoes of Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Generous Thinking here).
That’s where I’m at right now at least. Lots of loose threads and jumbled thoughts but at least a place to get started. One unresolved question for me is what makes this an argument about DH and not just pedagogy in general? Is it DH just because I am a DH person? Or does DH specifically have something to say about this? Is the DH audience, in particular, a good one for this? Or not? Things I’ll want to think further about in the future for certain. Without further ado, though, I’ll close with the draft table of contents and associated blog topics / questions. The arc of the project as I’m thinking it at the moment moves from micro to macro, from the classroom to larger questions of professional climate.
Draft Table of Contents and Ideas

Introduction
    
Where does DH teaching happen?
Where does infrastructural change happen?


Classroom experience
    
Kindness and generosity as skills that require training
Pedagogies of listening
How do we make the classroom a space where students can be sheltered from the academy and also create the conditions to transform it a la Jacqueline Wernimont?
What are the spaces of teaching, for DH in particular?


Labor
    
DH students as DH teachers
Neoliberal DH pedagogies
Expanding on the UCLA Student Collaborators’ Bill of Rights
Precarious labor and the labor of teaching


Infrastructure
    
As it impacts pedagogy and student life and teaching in particular; how do the small decisions we make at the level of administration reflect out pedagogies?
How can pedagogy be enacted beyond the classroom? How can we take teacherly actions as administrators?
How can those teacherly administrative actions address issues of precarity among the student population?
Your budget is a question of pedagogy and justice


Profession
    
Imposter syndrome. Where does imposter syndrome start for students? How can we address it?
Professional Development / Career Paths
Professional Imposters
Small changes / big changes


Conclusion – on inclusivity
    
How do we invite students into the profession and into higher education in a way that makes their voices heard and valued?
How can we ensure students are valued in online spaces? Or welcomed in spaces of open peer review?
Where to go from here?



Seems like plenty to go on for now. Now to get blogging!

Calling UVA graduate students! The spring semester is just beginning, but it’s never too early to think about next year. Applications are now open for the 2020-2021 cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2020. Consider spending some time with us!
If you’re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the program on Wednesday, February 19th from 11AM-12PM in New Cabell Hall 236. You are, of course, welcome to write to Brandon Walsh separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Graduate Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 1-2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow;
and your availability on the days we’ve identified for sixty-minute group interviews - March 23rd from 1-3pm or March 24th from 10-11. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to Brandon Walsh to express their interest and (once an application has been submitted) to let us know you have applied. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.

In September, I visited Emory University in conjunction with the launch of their new graduate fellowship for students aiming to incorporate digital projects in their dissertations. This is the second of two posts sharing materials from the events I took part in while there. I was asked to give a workshop on project development for graduate students as well as an open talk on digital humanities pedagogy. The text of what follows pertains to the open talk I gave, where I was asked to give a broad overview of how the Scholars’ Lab works with students. I write a talk for situations like these, but I try to avoid straight-up reading the text (more info on how I approach public speaking in DH available here). So what you will see below is more like a roadmap of the general gist of what we talked about. I did not consult the text too much in the moment. The only other relevant piece of framing that you will need is that I added the phrase “he works for the students” to the end of the bio I gave Sarah McKee (Senior Associate Director for Publishing at the Bill and Carol Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry) to read when she introduced me. Talk begins below!


Hello! I’m Brandon Walsh. I am the Head of Student Programs at the Scholars’ Lab, a community lab for experimental scholarship in all fields, particularly informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage. You will hear a lot more about what we mean by that in the talk to come, one that I have titled “Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Opportunities for Hope.” Thank you so much for having me and for coming today to hear me talk. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to speak with you.

I wanted to first start out by offering a couple links and thanks. If you need access to the slides or the transcript of this talk (or you’re interested in what I shared with your students in the workshop earlier today), you can find those resources at this top link. I have also made a Zotero collection here with all the resources I mention in the talk in case you want to take a look at them later on. And finally, most importantly, I wanted to take a moment to express gratitude to everyone whose work has brought me here today. I’m very grateful to all my colleagues in the Scholars’ Lab whose work you will hear about in a moment, especially Amanda Visconti, Ronda Grizzle, Jeremy Boggs, Laura Miller, and Shane Lin. And I would also like to express my thanks to Sarah McKee, Lisa Flowers, Anandi Silva Knuppel, and all the ECDS students for making this trip possible and invigorating.
Sarah asked me to give a high-level overview of the Scholars’ Lab and how we work with students. I will do that today, but my standard disclaimer about the Scholars’ Lab is that we are a complex entity with many different folks doing many kinds of jobs. And you will get a different path through our work depending on who you ask. I am the Head of Student Programs, so given my work and interests you might come away from this talk thinking, “they only work with students.” This is not true! We have an R&D team and spatial technologies staff that work with the entire university, students, faculty, and library staff alike on a variety of different projects related to digital scholarship, digital preservation, and digital project development. So what you will hear about today is about my own particular corner of the lab. One of my colleagues might have a different, overlapping story. My story is about our students, though I am happy to help flesh the full picture out for you if you would like during discussion.

At the risk of tipping my hand too early, I wanted to offer an overview of what is to come. I’ll move back and forth between example and theory, but the main takeaways, if I had to offer them are these. First, DH pedagogy does not just take place in the classroom, and it’s not just about DH. Second, digital humanities pedagogy is pedagogy. Third, DH pedagogy at every level should consider, intersect with, and reconstruct desire paths through the academy. I’ll talk more about all of these ideas in a moment. I’m not going to be offering any practical thoughts on how to carry out DH pedagogy, though I’m happy to do so in the discussion afterwards. This is more a talk about the animating philosophy for DH and pedagogy as we try to practice it in the lab, about the idea that teaching can offer spaces for hope in the university.

When Sarah invited me here today, as is usually the case for things like this, she asked me to send her a bio. I always dread this part of giving talks. When I was a student, I always felt like I hadn’t done enough, and I hated hearing people read my short list back to me. Now that I have been working in the field for a bit longer, I still find it embarrassing for different reasons. So I decided to take a cue from Chad Sansing of the Mozilla Foundation and do something with this moment of discomfort. In his bio on Medium he mentions, a bit tongue in cheek, “I teach for the users.”

I don’t want to spend my entire time here reiterating the plot of the 1982 movie Tron, but, in my reading at least, Sansing’s bio is a riff on a line from that movie: “he fights for the users.” The line describes the titular character of the movie, a security program who fights other fascist computer programs on behalf of the users who have been locked out of the computing world. It’s a lot. But I like Sansing’s adoption of it here, and I wanted to try it out for myself. I like the way that his bio ties up his identity into a kind of mission statement. “Who am I” becomes “why am I here?” He is here to teach, and he’s here to teach the users how to take back control of the web.
The bio I gave Sarah ended with the phrase “he works for the students.” That phrase is a mission statement and also the subject of this talk, which will deal with how we work in the Scholars’ Lab to have care and consideration towards our student collaborators suffuse everything we do. I’ll talk against the ideas that teaching only takes place in the classroom and that administrative work has nothing to do with teaching.  I’ll start with what we do in the lab “for the students” and why. Second, I’ll contextualize this briefly as happening against the backdrop of a larger crisis in higher education. Third, I’ll offer thoughts about how we can shape a DH pedagogy that responds to such emergencies.

To begin. In the Scholars’ Lab, we try to start by approaching the whole student. We try to think about how our decisions affect lives and need to be informed by lives. Because administrative choices matter in big ways for people. When an application date gets set, who is eligible for a fellowship, or what kinds of work we allow as permissible in a particular context - choices like these affect the journeys our students are on.
So I would like to start by talking about paths. This image by an English Councillor circulated on the Digital Pedagogy Lab hashtag last month, and it illustrates a phenomenon called a “desire path” or a “desire line” – I would wager we have all seen them before. Desire lines are the paths made, over time, by people stepping on the same, unplanned path. They typically represent the organic actions of pedestrians as opposed to what was planned by the city designer. In this case, based on the Twitter conversation, the path you’re looking at appears to have been made over time by cyclists in response to the constructions you see on the left, obstacles deliberately put in place to discourage cyclists speeding along on this paved path. It is not difficult to imagine the accessibility issues caused by this same construction choice.
I’m taken with this image as a metaphor for the life of a graduate student in academia (caveat here that most of my comments will be about graduate students given who I tend to work with, but I think they are relevant for students generally as well). The image certainly resonates with me, coming as I do to work in the library without a library professional degree but instead with a PhD in English. In short, our students might get into this space for one reason, and we might imagine paths through it on their behalf. But everyone finds their own way through their own education and often through different means and to different ends than we anticipate. I certainly got pulled sideways at a certain point and wound up in a place I could not have envisioned at the beginning of my time at UVA.
I often wonder in related ways about my own activities in the administration of the Scholars’ Lab and in higher education more generally. In my role, I’m often making or offering small choices that are likely to affect the course of someone’s journey through their time as a student. These individual, local interventions in a person’s path - how do they fit into the larger journey for them? Am I helping people to form their own desire paths? Or am I the one throwing up barriers? How can I take those barriers down or help pave a new path to help the route be a little easier? Who am I to be making such decisions for other people? How can I take the responsibility of these choices as seriously as possible?
Given this logic of the desire path, for student programs to service your community in a perfect world you will be offering a diverse slate of opportunities. Because your student population does not just have broad and diverse disciplinary research questions – they also come from a range of different backgrounds and life situations. An MA student, at UVA at least, has a different course load and does not typically teach. This puts them in a fundamentally different category financially, with different pressures and needs, from a PhD student. And what works for one will not work for the other. That is to say, any conversation about DH pedagogy, for me, starts and ends with a discussion of the lived circumstances of the students. Our student activities in the lab are foremost informed by a consideration for the diverse contexts and backgrounds that our students represent.

We try to make our programs fit those many needs, and we try to offer a number of different ways in to do so. The phrase “for the students” that I mentioned earlier is also pretty close to a page on our website where I try to collect everything that a student might be interested in knowing about us. This is the “For Students” page of the Scholars’ Lab website if you would like to check it out at scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/for-students. I will talk about a few of these pieces in detail first from a nuts and bolts standpoint and then a theoretical one, though I am happy to talk in more depth about any one of them.

We regularly offer two hourly wage positions for students in the lab. The first is that we employ hourly students in our makerspace as technologists assisting community members with 3D printing jobs, experimental electronics, or sewing and wearable electronics. No experience is necessary for a student to take on the role, and we typically train people up on the job. There are a number of makerspaces on campus, but ours is distinct for being committed to teaching folks how to do the printing themselves. So you don’t drop off a file and pick up a print - you learn how the technologies work. And our makerspace primarily caters to humanities students, though we do get a fair amount of traffic from science students who tend to find our space less crowded than the ones provided by the Engineering School.

Second, our GIS specialists Drew McQueen and Chris Gist service needs related to spatial technologies for the entire University, and they regularly employ a GIS student collaborator to assist them in doing so. This student and these projects can come from across the university – not just the humanities. And they also frequently collaborate with local and regional governmental organizations on a variety of different geospatial projects. Our students are there at each step along the way as collaborators.

We also engage students in an internship for course credit through the architecture school, where our 3D Technologies Specialist, Will Rourk, collaborates with them on the scanning of artifacts and spaces that are significant for cultural heritage purposes. They often carry out site visits in the region, and Will also collaborates with local museums on scanning objects of importance to them.

Will then engages those same students in the production of 3D data based on these objects. Through the process, our student interns get a deep introduction to all different parts of a 3D data pipeline, and the work that they all do together is truly impressive. The previous tweet and this 3D model all relate to the McCormick observatory on UVA’s campus.

Beyond these opportunities, we also offer two yearlong fellowship programs that offer deeper dives into digital humanities. These are the programs that I most directly supervise. Our higher-level DH fellowship is for advanced PhD students at the dissertation stage who want to work on a project related to their research. They teach some, but they are largely doing a deep dive into developing a professional portfolio that will serve them on the job market. And our Praxis Program is something of an introduction to digital humanities by way of project-based pedagogy. The six students in this fellowship each year form a cohort and work collaboratively on a self-designed project over the course of two semesters. The students drive the program: the fall feels more like a seminar or workshop with us at the front of the room, but the spring is owned by them. We flick them in a direction, but they take the project and develop it in a way that feels authentically theirs both in spirit, scope, and shape.
So that’s a piece of what we do in the lab, and you might have noticed just how much we do for students. I am well aware that the Scholars’ Lab is in a privileged position as far as resources go, both for centers for digital research and even within our own library. Over 2/3 of our budget goes directly to students, and we work directly with about 50 students each year. That’s a lot. As anyone who works with budgets knows, our own budget is the result of longstanding and ongoing campaigns for more resources. I am grateful for allies in the library who recognize the value of supporting students and especially to those who fought for years before I was involved to get those numbers to where they are. These numbers are not settled, and we have to work to keep them every year. But I bring these points up to ask - what can an institution without this level of support do? What can an individual without the support of an institution do? What are small actions we can take in our pedagogy - particularly our DH pedagogy - to help the desire paths our students are trying to make for themselves, even when we’re limited by resource scarcity?

For me, one way of approaching these questions is to think more deeply about what we mean when we think of pedagogy. I remember one conversation I had about teaching, when a colleague offhandedly said, “Oh well I don’t teach.” And a nearby colleague agreed as well. I remember doing a double take. These were people who, to my mind, were constantly engaged in the work of teaching.

Even besides the workshops they regularly give, these were people who mentored students, helped with their projects, and pair programmed beside them to help them learn. Furthermore, they’re fantastic teachers. The general culture in the Scholars’ Lab is one in which we constantly engage in peer mentoring. Digital Humanities is hard - there are so many fields. No one knows all of it, and we try to offer a spirit of generous assistance to each other every day as we find our way through this field. How, then, did I have an entirely different view of these colleagues than they did of their own work?
I think my colleagues were equating teaching with teaching classes as instructors of record. And, to be fair, sometimes I’m asked whether I am teaching or not in the upcoming semester, and I don’t quite know how to respond either. While I sometimes teach semester-long courses, my primary work is not in such traditional modes of instruction. While it’s not really the question they’re asking, my gut response is usually to think, “when am I not teaching?”

This is to say that pedagogy is not something that only happens in the classroom. I especially like the way that Sean Michael Morris describes this notion in an interview with Jesse Stommel. They’re two prominent scholar-practitioners of critical digital pedagogy, and they’re the chief instigators behind Digital Pedagogy Lab. In an interview about their new collection An Urgency of Teachers, Morris describes pedagogy as not something we just enact in the classroom. Instead, it’s a system of beliefs that we carry with us. A way of orienting ourselves in the world. Or at least it should be. If we think about teaching and pedagogy as things that only take place when we’re in front of a classroom or with our names in an LMS, then I would argue that we’re not thinking of teaching in the fullest possible sense. The spaces for teaching are vast, and our students many. To be “for the students,” we need to think of education as a way of life. As something that runs deeper than sharing material with students. This about how we view them and their work. We’re always teaching, whether or not we’re in front of students for a whole semester.

It’s one thing to believe having values like these are important. But in the Lab we also believe it’s important to share them, and now we’re getting into the philosophy behind what we do. We believe it is important to write our work philosophies down and to explicitly say them in public. In the Scholars’ Lab, we believe in explicit statements of values called charters, documents that spell out your beliefs, goals, and ambitions. We have had our cohorts of Praxis students put charters together describing their shared ambitions and values each year for the last nine years. Here you have one of the Praxis charters from one of the early cohorts. They cite free and generous credit, transparency, and an awareness of each other’s diverse backgrounds and disciplinary interests as important markers for them. The hope is that by encouraging our students to examine their shared group identity we will draw out a richer sense of themselves and each other.
Last year in conversation with Jeremy Boggs we realized that, even though we have our students write a charter every year, we hadn’t actually done one of our own, as a staff, for our student programs. We possessed a general charter for the lab, but we thought our student programs needed to explicitly share their own pedagogical philosophy and promises. It was time to make things clear and explicit. So we wrote one together. For the students.

You can find the whole charter on our website at scholarslab.org/student-programs-charter, and I’d encourage you to read it. It’s a document that is not perfect, but it’s one that I’m glad is out in the world. Here are a few excerpts from it that describe our approach to teaching.

We’re here, and we care. We trust in students. We teach the whole person. We’re committed to advancing pedagogical practices that are equitable, just, and ethical. It’s important that our students know where we stand, and one of the first things I have our students do is read this document along with the more general charter for the Scholars’ Lab. Our pedagogies, the ways we think about our work with students, should be shared with them. In the Lab we believe they should be part of the conversation.
Lest you think this is an artifact of the quotes I chose to emphasize, the charter doesn’t actually talk an awful lot about technology. It does occasionally, but only in oblique ways. We want our students to own their projects as well as their domains. We want them to fail in public in a way that pushes their comfort zone but not their safety. We all feel like imposters - many of us everyday. Some of you probably feel like imposters right now. I know I do. These points imply a certain interdisciplinary approach to technology, even though they are not specific to digital humanities.
And it’s also not lost on me that I’ve spent most of this talk on digital humanities pedagogy not talking all that much about digital humanities pedagogy. And that’s part of the point.

Digital humanities pedagogy is pedagogy. I’ll say that again. Digital humanities pedagogy is pedagogy. Similarly, to go back to Digital Pedagogy Lab, I’ve heard Sean Michael Morris say that the “digital” part of DPL is just an excuse to get people in the room to talk about pedagogy. The definition of digital humanities I usually give to students is one I draw from Elizabeth Grumbach: DH is asking humanities questions of technology and asking humanities questions with technology. DH pedagogy is certainly teaching that engages with those topics, materials, and methods, but leaving it there is akin to saying that you only teach if you’re an instructor of record.
Because I feel a tad guilty staying wholly theoretical I want to pause for a moment to say that there are great resources for digital humanities pedagogy from a practical perspective: I highly recommend Using Digital Humanities in the Classroom, co-authored by Claire Battershill and Shawna Ross, and Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities, edited by Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers. These resources are exemplary for those seeking practical advice and examples on how to teach digital humanities.
But what I mean by “DH pedagogy is pedagogy” is that, for us in the Scholars’ Lab, a digital humanities pedagogy is one that thinks deeply and critically about the teaching itself and the interpersonal, societal, and institutional changes it purports to make. It’s not just about the classroom. That is to say, we certainly teach DH methods, tools, and thinking, but we’re more directly trying to think about how and why we do this work and what larger implications it might have. Digital humanities might be an especially good opportunity to make these sorts of interventions, and that brings me to the quote that the title of this talk is riffing on.

“Opportunities for Hope” is a play on Henry Giroux quoting the work of Paulo Freire. In full it reads: “Hope demanded an anchoring in transformative practices, and one of the tasks of the progressive educator was to ‘unveil opportunities for hope, no matter what the obstacles may be.’” For Freire, education in its best shape was always about social reform, and he called for new forms of teaching that empowered students and upended traditional modes of instruction like the banking model for education that assumes students are empty vessels who need to have the knowledge of the instructor given to them only to regurgitate it back. And it’s this same spirit of transformation that we bring to the students who work with us in the Scholars’ Lab. How can our pedagogical practices as digital humanists open up space for new ideas for students, but more importantly, for imagining new lives? How can we unveil opportunities for hope, no matter the difficulties? Beyond simply giving them tools and methods, how can we go further and make the teaching we do be a political intervention?

More specifically, how do we unveil opportunities for hope in a climate like the one in which we all live, where it often feels higher education is on fire? Tenure track positions are vanishing, adjunctification is on the rise, and an enormous number of students and staff are in precarious positions. A so-called “free speech” crisis threatens actual free expression and freethinking in our classrooms. I could go on and on. I spoke about the privileged position the Scholars’ Lab is in, in terms of funding. But, no matter how much funding we’re able to direct to students, it’s never enough. There are always more students applying for fellowships than we have spots to give. Since I’ve been teaching, students have spoken with me about homelessness, food insecurity, precarious finances, uncertain job futures, mental health crises, chronic health conditions, and more. And I know the student populations I’ve worked with are not unique in higher education. How do we find hope for ourselves and for our students in the face of these situations? And what can pedagogy do here? I’ll offer three provisional responses to this question. In the face of a crisis in higher education, we should think of the work we do as creating spaces of shelter and intervention, as empowering student voices, and as changing culture more broadly.

My first response is that we can think of the teaching work that we do in digital humanities spaces as work that seeks to shelter and also to intervene. “What is a feminist lab?” was a symposium that took place at University of Colorado Boulder earlier this year. I got permission from Jacqueline Wernimont to cite her remarks, quoted here: “A lab can be a technology to survive the institutions we work in while we seek to transform them.” Our students in the Scholars’ Lab frequently refer to it as an oasis in the larger academy, by which I take them to mean that we value their futures, their concerns, and anxieties in ways that are not as well supported elsewhere. As they develop charters and have conversations about the values they want to develop and promote during their time with us, I often encourage them to think of it as an opportunity to shape the sort of kind, generous, and transformative space they want to see in the academy.
That is to say, we also engage students in a wide variety of support that is not particular to wage employment or research. Some of these are programmatic. We offer mock interviews if students wind up applying for library or digital humanities related jobs. We read materials. We circulate job postings relevant to this kind of work. But more generally we have frank conversations with students about our lives and theirs and try to make space for them in ways that might otherwise be difficult in other parts of the university. Our fellowships don’t carry grades, we allow deferment of our fellowships, and we generally try to make lives a little easier. For us, this is the work of pedagogy, and the fact that we are operating in a library-based digital humanities space helps facilitate this. Your own mileage may vary, as your circumstances are likely to be different. Given your own limitations, how can you use your position as teachers to inject more kindness into the academy?

Second – we can respond by asking, “where are the students?”
It’s important that we keep student interests and needs in mind. They are an important audience for our work, but sometimes they can disappear from the conversation when we discuss long-term strategy. So simply asking how students fit in is a place to start, and even small actions like making sure the word “student” appears on mission statements can be important interventions. But we can go further.  Student voices need to be included in discussions about their own education. Digital humanities pedagogy is often quite amenable to this, as project-based pedagogy of the sort that is common in DH can often invite students to have an active role in shaping their experiences. The UCLA Student Collaborator Bill of Rights has other good advice for how to engage student voices and to make sure that you’re doing so in an ethical way. It’s a touchstone for us in the Lab.

The Small Liberal Arts Community (as exemplified by ILiADS) offers fantastic models for how you can engage students as true partners in research projects and disrupt the labor distinctions that all too often exist in our work. I’d encourage you to explore the ILiADS site for examples of projects that might offer models as you think through how to work with students. For my money, the SLAC community is offering some of the most exciting digital pedagogy work. This kind of flattened distinction between student and teacher, as much as possible, is something we try to aim for in the Scholars’ Lab. It’s expressed in a concise way, I think, in this Instagram story by Nicholas Payton, a prominent jazz trumpet player and composer.

In a recent “ask me anything” session on Instagram, Payton was asked, “Who are the best trumpet teachers alive right now?” He responded, “There are no great teachers, only great students who give tools to other students.” That is the world I want to live in. A world in which the Scholars’ Lab students see themselves as experts, and in which their staff and faculty see themselves as equal partners in the pursuit of knowledge.
We’re all students at the end of the day.

This can sometimes feel difficult to square with digital humanities, though, where often we quite literally have things we need to share with students that they are encountering for the first time. One thing we try to do in the Lab, beyond adapting our curriculum to the needs of the students, is talk to our students about the work of teaching and learning in which we are all engaged. We talk to them about why we are doing what we are doing, what difficulties we’re having, and what thoughts they might have for making a better experience.
For example, I mentioned the Praxis Program, our yearlong fellowship where our students go from soup-to-nuts with digital humanities, from knowing little to launching their own collaborative digital project by the end. For years, the interdisciplinary makeup of the team has been a recipe for real interpersonal conflict. Usually in March. Every year, right when the rubber hits the road and they’re trying to launch their project. Finally this past year we decided to talk to the team about it.
During the second session of Praxis this year, Amanda Visconti and I ran a discussion for our new cohort of Praxis students on good collaboration and community. And we laid this pedagogical problem out – we talked about issues we had in the program in the past not as interpersonal issues between specific people but as expressions of larger difficulties in collaborative work. We discussed what seemed to help and what did not. What’s more, we also talked about what good collaboration looked like for each other and how the students could make sure they treated each other with respect and kindness first. The students took the conversation very seriously. Last year was the best year yet as far as collaboration is concerned, and Amanda and I just ran the conversation for a new cohort last week. In short, there’s no need to treat pedagogy like something that has to be hidden from your students. Particularly in DH, as it asks so much of students professionally, interpersonally, and emotionally, we need to involve student voices in the development of good teaching practices. They deserve it, and everyone’s experience will be enriched.
Third, and I think it’s apparent from this talk, we have to think about the work that we do, even at the level of the individual assignment, as engaged in a larger project of shifting the culture of the university. When I spoke to the graduate students earlier today, we ended our workshop by talking about values. The workshop was called “getting from here to there” with a digital project, but the point was that there is always going to be another project. Another semester. Another student. It’s more important to think about why you’re doing this work: what are the animating philosophies behind what you’re doing? I’ve tried to give you a glimpse today of the “why” for the Scholars’ Lab.
I encouraged the students earlier to think about their work as opportunities to open up small spaces for more generous, kind, and productive spaces in the academy, to imagine the future they want to see into the world. In the Lab we see our work as part of a larger attempt to shift the culture of the university, both in terms of what graduate training in the humanities can look like but also in terms of what kinds of conversations are acceptable.

At UVA, we’re plugged into a larger network of like-minded programs working to train graduate students for a broad range of lives and future careers. This program, called PHD+, has been instrumental for us in helping to see that the work we’re doing as being part of a larger movement to rethink what graduate education can look like. Thinkers like Katina Rogers and Cathy Davidson, both at CUNY, and Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel, co-founders of the Digital Pedagogy Lab, have been instrumental for me in seeing the work of the classroom as intimately connected to the work outside it. And, to go back to my point about student voices, we talk about these issues explicitly with our students. We have a session on diverse career options for them, on labor precarity and employment in digital humanities. We’re not solely interested in getting them jobs; we want to make sure that they can find their ways to happy futures no matter the outcome.

So to bring it back to an earlier image and earlier questions - when working on DH pedagogy decisions I’d encourage you to think about this image. I know I will. How are our decisions helping people navigate their own desire paths through the university? Throwing up new barriers for them? Paving new roads? How can we make even small assignments part of larger culture shifts? How might digital humanities pedagogy, in libraries and out of them, make space for these conversations?
That’s my talk. Thanks for listening. I’m happy to talk more about Tron, the Scholars’ Lab, nuts and bolts of digital humanities pedagogy, other opportunities for hope, and anything else you’d like.

We are now accepting applications for the 2020-2021 Digital Humanities Fellowship Cohort.
The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2020-2021 academic year is Monday, November 25th, 2019 at 11:59 PM. We will do our best to render decisions by late December.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.

Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1
Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.

How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials, all of which should be emailed directly to Brandon Walsh:

a cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:
    
a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;
a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
a description of Scholars’ Lab and UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;
and a description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career.


a Graduate Fellowship Application Form;
a dissertation abstract;
2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation (these letters can be sent in by email to Brandon Walsh);
and your availability for a 30-minute interview slot sometime on Monday, December 9th from 9:00AM-10:00AM, 11:00AM-12:00PM, or 1:30PM-4:00PM. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around the 9th or 10th of December.

Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well.



Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award. ↩

A few weeks ago, I visited Emory University in conjunction with the launch of their new graduate fellowship for students aiming to incorporate digital projects in their dissertations. This is the first of two posts sharing materials from the two events I took part in while there. I was asked to give a workshop on project development for graduate students as well as an open talk on digital humanities pedagogy. The text of what follows pertains to the workshop for students, where I was asked to give a broad overview of how to approach project planning and some activities for helping them think through their work for the year. I essentially tried to condense the greatest hits of the Praxis Program into 90 minutes. I was asked to give a 30 minute talk and 60 minute workshop, but I’ll get into how we shifted things around below.
First, a few caveats. For one, I write a talk for situations like these, but I try to avoid straight-up reading the text (more info on how I approach public speaking in DH available here). So what you’ll see below is more like a roadmap of the general gist of what we talked about. I don’t remember consulting the text too much in the moment, and I know for a fact that the last few paragraphs were dramatically different in person. Second, and related - since this was meant to be a workshop and not a lecture I planned on a fair amount of discussion with the really thoughtful and engaged students.
All of this is to say that I planned on deviating from my plan, and I tried to represent that below. In the text that follows you’ll find the actual running text of a talk and workshop plan along with notes to you, the reader, marked with [sidebar: brackets] describing how I modified things in the moment to adapt to the group and the conversation as it unfolded. You’ll get a mix of both the script for the presentation and some notes on how I managed things as it diverted from expectations. It might get a little confusing, but I imagine it could be interesting to see how things got restructured and shifted around in the moment.
Planning for a span of time as long as 90 minutes is difficult, so I deliberately planned far more than I could cover in the allotted time just in case. I went into it knowing I’d need to be flexible. If I had to offer any suggestions for workshops in general it would be this - plan more than you need but do not try to rush to make it through your material. Let the conversation and the discussion shape the pace of your teaching, not a need to cover a particular amount of content. I always find it more helpful to do more with less. In this case, it meant that I was watching the clock from the beginning and looking for milestones along the way where, if needed, I could wrap things up.
[Sidebar: we’re in talk land now. What follows is the rough script of the talk and discussion that Anandi Silva Knuppel, Sarah McKee, and I fielded together.]
Getting from Here to There

Hey friends! How is it going? I’m Brandon Walsh, the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab in the UVA Library. The Scholars’ Lab is a center for experimental scholarship informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage thinking. For the purposes of our conversation today, my work with students is probably most relevant. I facilitate a number of different fellowship programs and student opportunities in the lab, where I’m in charge of everything from mundane administrative tasks to more abstract things like constructing our pedagogical mission. And I collaborate with a range of people in the Lab and the Library to carry out different kinds of teaching for our community. I work with students from a range of disciplines, which means I have a fair amount of experience helping people plan, scope, and execute projects. I’ve titled this workshop “Getting from Here to There.”

[First sidebar: Anandi Silva Knuppel was the one who invited me to speak at Emory, and she gave a general orientation to their fellowship program before I started my piece. She included several photos of her children and family in the talk, and I quickly realized that the tone of my section would feel like a weird shift from hers. So, while she was presenting, I threw in a bunch of photos of the cat my partner and I recently adopted. This is Pepper, and he makes numerous appearances in what follows.]

Before we get started, I wanted to offer some resources and gratitude. If you need the text or slides of this talk for any reason, you can find them at the first link here. The second link will take you to a Zotero collection for this talk, so you don’t necessarily need to rapidly write down the links to things as we’re going. I’ve collected them for you. I wanted to credit my colleagues at the Scholars’ Lab, whose work I’ll discuss in what follows. Amanda Visconti, Ronda Grizzle, Jeremy Boggs, Laura Miller, and Shane Lin especially show up in the following slides. And, finally, I wanted to thank Sarah McKee, Lisa Flowers, Anandi Silva Knuppel, and everyone at ECDS and the Fox Center for the Humanities for the invitation to talk here. I’m truly flattered and grateful.

In terms of what we’ll cover today, I’m planning on taking you through a series of questions related to DH project planning roughly organized around questions pertaining to the how, what, who, and why of digital projects. This is my roadmap through the topic, and I’m happy to just lecture at you. But it’d be great to have questions and discussion as relevant and necessary. So please do interrupt. The conversation will be better for your contributions and better for your ideas. Ultimately this is about making it useful for you. So tell me what you need, and I’m happy to go where you want. I won’t necessarily have all the answers, but I’m happy to talk together.
[Sidebar: I had planned on running some icebreakers to get to know the students and their work, but Sarah and Anandi actually did this during their opening orientation for the program. So the slide I had planned on getting to know each other became wholly irrelevant. Instead, I realized that I should share a little bit about my own background as it pertained to the topic at hand. So during Anandi’s orientation I inserted a couple slides about the Lab and myself.]

So I’ve learned a little about you, but who am I? I work in digital humanities now, but I didn’t actually start doing anything with DH until I was a graduate student myself. I didn’t even know of it as a term until I became interested in the fellowships that my friends were doing in the Scholars’ Lab. It took a few years of finding my feet, but the digital project I worked on for my dissertation had to with Virginia Woolf and machine learning, and it was a project that taught me a lot about myself, my work, and what I wanted out of life. So believe me when I say that you are all far more advanced than I was at the same point in my career. You’re doing great! And you are well prepared for the projects you’re working on.
[Sidebar: During Anandi’s orientation, one of the fellows asked a question about how their own program at Emory compared to the larger landscape of digital humanities graduate programs. Was it unique? How did it compare to other fellowships? So I called another audible and inserted the following slide about the Scholars’ Lab programs so that the students could get context for how things might be structured differently. It’s different aesthetically because, well, it’s from a different talk! I copied and pasted it in quickly from the talk I’d be giving at Emory later that evening.]

Based on your question about other graduate programs in DH, I thought it might be worth pausing for just a moment to share what our students do with us in the Scholars’ Lab. At the Lab, we have two year-long fellowship programs. The Praxis Program is something of a soup to nuts introduction to digital humanities for students early in their graduate career. These students typically come in without much experience in digital technologies, but the goal for us over the course of a year is to get them in a position for them to launch their own collaborative digital project. The second fellowship listed here is our year-long Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities, a program for people with more experience and who are working to tie DH to their dissertation projects in some way. These students work with a point of contact on our R&D team for the year to develop their project, and students in both programs give public presentations by the end of the year. If you’re interested in learning more, I’m happy to talk at greater length about our individual programs. The Praxis Network might also be a useful resource - it’s a website that archives snapshots of several like-minded programs at one point in time, so on that project you get glimpses at several different approaches to graduate education.

Let’s get started. I titled this talk “Getting from here to there” because, to me, that’s the most difficult thing about planning any project. And this is particularly true for a student digital humanities project. I like this image because the alt text for it, the text meant to describe its contents for accessibility purposes, is “man standing in hallway.” It showed up when I did a search on Unsplash for “future.” I don’t know about you, but I have a hard time seeing a person in that photo. And when you’re starting out with any kind of digital project that’s part of the challenge. How do you get from point A to point B? How do you get your project from here to there? And how do you place yourself within it?

Now I’m just trying to show you snazzy images, but starting a digital project often puts me in this position. I feel like I’m learning to walk for the first time, and each step seems insurmountable. Each step brings new anxieties, and I’d like to know more about yours. I learned a little about your work, but I’d like to know a little more about your questions. What is the single biggest question you have right now about getting started? What is your single biggest anxiety about the year to come?
[Sidebar: I had budgeted a little time to have the students discuss concerns, but we wound up talking for longer than I anticipated (it turns out I really wanted to help them work through things). At this point, because we had started the workshop a tad late after lunch, I was already becoming aware that we were going to run out of time. We were only about 15 minutes into the 90-minute session, but I had already changed my sense of the timeline for the talk. The questions the students asked were very good. So good, that it seemed as though they were plants. They talked broadly about concerns that they might not have meaningful contributions to make to the field more broadly at this stage in their work, anxieties about finding their way into the DH community, questions about professionalization, and more. Sarah and I fielded them together. The questions worked well as a transition, because I correctly anticipated that some of them would feel like imposters.]
Those are all excellent questions. And part of the message I want you to take away today is that questions like that are all normal. It is normal not to know the answers. Behind all of your questions I heard implied another, particular anxiety.

[Sidebar: insert joke about Pepper looking stressed while working.]

Behind your concerns, really at their core, I heard questions about imposterdom. When am I going to be exposed for the fraud that I am? I have no idea what I’m doing – when am I going to be found out? I am here to tell you today that almost everyone feels this way. And if you don’t – you’re a Dunning-Kruger, as this chart explains. This feeling – imposter syndrome – is something we live with all through our lives. I’m feeling it right now! And I think it shows that you’re a good, thoughtful, reflective, well-meaning person. This article by Tanya X. Short has some excellent strategies for working through your feelings of imposterdom. I recommend it. But I also recommend you take a deep breath, close your eyes, and recognize that you belong here. You can do this project, and you have a community of people here to help you. I’m also happy to help in any way I can if you want to reach out after this event. But more practically, there are some helpful resources and methods I can share with you for how you can get started. Because one way you can address imposter syndrome is by doing what you always do as academics. Do research. Prepare. Use the resources available to you. The process for digital work does have key differences that I can help you think through. But it is not so wholly alien and different as it might seem at first glance. I have a series of questions that I usually talk through with newcomers to digital projects as they’re thinking for the first time about this kind of work, and I’ll be giving you a version of that conversation today.
Reminder: interrupt me at any time. To begin.

How will you go about your work? On a day-to-day basis, what is the process by which you will carry out your work? You might be getting to the point where you have good,  personal project management styles that work for you as you’re writing your dissertation. If you don’t, now is a good time to develop them. But it can always be helpful to hear about other strategies. Know thyself in the first instance – find what works for you and stick to it. But don’t be afraid to try out something new.

Who here has heard of Trello? We don’t explicitly use this tool in the Scholars’ Lab as a whole staff, but we use it on the technical board for one of the journals I’m involved with – the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. It’s pretty simple - the idea is that each task gets a card associated with it that you can comment on and move around. Nothing too earth shattering here, but these task management systems become increasingly important as your projects grow in complexity and as you begin to work with collaborators. They’re especially good for humanities projects, in particular, because we’re not used to thinking in terms like this. How do you take a complicated humanities problem and break it into smaller, completable steps? Doing this with technical work can help keep you from burning out and help you feel that you’re moving forward. It can make the whole process of getting from here to there feel doable. You’ll likely be bad at it at first and have trouble with task managing. That’s OK! It’s a skill you can develop like anything else.

If you’ve ever talked to anyone else about the way that they work, you’ve probably realized that everyone takes on projects in different ways. Even writing. When I was writing my dissertation, I would use the “add comment” feature in Microsoft Word to leave myself tasks on the document itself. Any page would have hundreds of comments that I would sort through when I sat down to write and was looking for where to begin for the day. I would be shocked if anyone else used this weird, idiosyncratic system of mine.
Digital work is no different - we all have different ways of going about it. But it’s helpful to get everyone working from the same book if not exactly on the same page. In a corporate context, it can save time, money, and energy if your team has a shared philosophy towards your workflow and project management. This can be true of humanities and DH work as well. In the Scholars’ Lab, we use an approach to project management called Agile Development. The basics of it are before you in this diagram. The general idea is that you work in two-week sprints (at least in the way that I implement it with our students). At the end of each sprint you reflect on where you’re at, what you need help with, and what you need for next steps. A scrum is a term taken from rugby, and it is a set of tools and methodologies for conducting these of check-ins, whether they happen daily or at the end of your sprints. In our staff scrums, for example, we go around the room and ask for two-minute updates (max) describing what you are currently working on, what is next for you, and what you are not working on. But for your purposes here today, you can just think of it as a two-week sprint followed by a meeting to touch base. And then you repeat. We do this with our fellows, who have biweekly scrums with their R&D points of contact.
That explains the center of the diagram. The left side of it refers, I believe, to the idea that you should break your larger project down into smaller tasks that you can accomplish in two-week sprints. That way you have a good sense of progress. In a student project situation, this might be as simple as “I’m going to work through this chapter from this programming book and come to you with the progress I’ve made and the questions I have.” And if a task can’t be accomplished in two weeks it’s probably actually several smaller tasks lumped into one. Break your tasks down until you find something you can do in that window of time. One last thing here – notice the emphasis on circular shapes and the word “potentially.” One of the core concepts of agile development is the idea that iteration is good. It actually saves you time, energy, and, in the corporate world, money to produce something early that might be half baked and get feedback on it. This allows you to learn from your mistakes and iterate on your materials. It requires a certain amount of humility to work like this, and it’s radically different from what we’re used to in academia. Produce something for other eyes? Before it’s perfect? Perish the thought.

But truly – I’m here to tell you that perfectionism, while often encouraged in academia, can be a significant barrier to getting things done (and hint – also a cause of imposter syndrome). The Cult of Done Manifesto is a document I adore that gets at this point. “Accept that everything is a draft,” it reads. Your project is a draft. You’re a draft! It helps to think about ourselves as works in progress. The Cult of Done Manifesto isn’t a text that necessarily comes from the agile community per se, but they have overlapping concerns. Iteration is a part of our practice. It’s how we learn.
It’s worth considering that not everyone is equally able to iterate or develop in public – women, people of color, and other marginalized communities have different experiences of the world and of digital life. And the internet, the public audience for much digital work, is toxic. But it’s worth at least thinking about how you can push yourself to rethink the practices with which you’re comfortable in spaces that allow you to do so. I’m not really talking about a binary, where, on the one hand, things are kept fully private until they are absolutely perfect and, on the other, you’re publishing every piece of half-finished work for all to see. Find what makes sense to you. Consider how you can take small steps that work for you in the direction of being more comfortable with your work in progress as something worth sharing.

One last note on agile. The agile community released a series of principles that are worth pausing over. I’ll read them. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan. Keep in mind that these come from the software world. Let’s take a moment to think about them. What do you notice about them? How might these apply to your own work as a humanities student? As a DH student? What are they missing?
[Sidebar: At this point I paused for discussion and questions. My goal was to get the students to think about questions of communication, self-reflection, and iteration as they might pertain to their own work. The students had great thoughts and questions about how to apply agile thinking to digital projects and dissertations. One that stuck out to me - how could you apply these sorts of ideas to a project where you were, really, the sole person working on the project? I suggested in response that, first, you could project manage yourself in the same way you would a team and that, second, projects were almost always the product of many hands, even if they might appear to be the work of a solo individual. Think deeply about the help you might be overlooking and how you can better structure those relationships.]

Lists of principles like this are often helpful, so here is my own spin on the conversation. If I had to offer four principles for DH project planning, I might offer these. Give yourself permission to keep it small. Work iteratively. Credit generously. Connect it to you. There could be many others, and I might give you a different list depending on the day of the week. But they’re a start. We’ll talk more about what some of these points mean shortly.

Everything we’ve talked about so far could be filed under the question of how you’ll do your work. But, at this early stage, you’re probably also thinking about - obsessing about - the what. What exactly do I want to do with this project? One project management tip: this can be a dangerous question. For humanities students and faculty, it’s all too common to want your idea to go deeper, further, more complex. You’re trained to deconstruct and push ideas. This is great when writing a book or teaching a class. But in a digital project each of these potential ideas represents time and energy on your part. Digital projects aren’t developed at the speed of an idea or the speed of writing. They take time to implement. And each new idea takes more time.
Instead, I want to suggest you think about a related question as enlivening.

Instead of asking, “what do I want to do?” you might ask, “what don’t I want to do?” It’s a powerful question. But it is very, very hard to ask it of yourself. And it’s a question whose value only becomes clear with experience. You learn the value of it the hard way. Put another way - check out this image.

Feature creep refers to a tendency for projects to creep along, growing in size, way beyond their original intention. And at a certain point, like this tool here, a project becomes unwieldy and useless. You can’t even pick it up without stabbing yourself. We’ve all worked with tools or interfaces like this – so many options that you can’t do anything at all. When you continue to layer more and more ideas, more and more features, onto a project, things can quickly spin out of control.
This is an especially difficult problem for students of digital humanities because they’re often coming to these questions for the first time. So you don’t know if an idea is a reasonable one or totally impossible. Spoiler alert - this a problem even among professionals. We’re all dealing with this all the time. So I wanted to give you a few ways to think about scoping out features.

[Sidebar: I believe I made a joke here about Pepper’s reaction to feature creep.]

I wanted to share two quotes from a conversation we had about project scoping during my time as a student in the Scholars’ Lab. Apologies if I don’t get the exact wording right - this was a decade ago after all. Here is Wayne Graham, former Head of R&D in the Scholars’ Lab, discussing how he plans out work on a project. He takes any estimate his staff gives him and multiplies by pi, because things always take longer than anticipated, even for professionals.
Now, here is a quote from Bethany Nowviskie, former Head of the Scholars’ Lab and Wayne’s boss.

“I take whatever estimate Wayne gives me and double it.” It was a conversation that really stuck with me. Multiply any estimate for how long a project or task will take by two pi. That’s a lot longer than expected!
How, then, can you decide what’s worth doing? In the face of these kinds of difficulties, it’s helpful to have some sort of a system in place for determining the value of what you’re thinking about doing. This is especially helpful in humanities work, where sometimes the features we’re talking about directly build upon our own ideas about things we care about. It can all feel very personal. It can be helpful to try to make things objective. Here’s one way to do so.

Here’s a checklist for you as you go about your work. Is this feature hard? And is it important? These questions are difficult to answer when starting out, so it can be good to ask for help as you think through them. But it’s also a skill that you can develop with experience. So take the time to try to break your large project into as many components as possible.
Let’s practice together. Take the idea of a digital archive. That’s a big thing. But you could poke at a lot of pieces of it. Say…you were going to make an archive of American protest. What are some decisions you would have to make about it? What would some features be?

[Sidebar: had we more time, at this point I would have paused to actually run the speculative exercise for designing a digital archive, something I’ve done in courses before. I was watching the clock, though, and felt I needed to just give a few conceptual takeaways before moving on. I asked the students to consider a range of different questions that would impact the features and scale of such an archive. Will the archive be private or public? Will it index everything about the topic from all countries in all years? Maybe just one year? Maybe just one country? All types of media? Maybe just text? Will people be able to add to it? If they can add to it, will you have to moderate their contributions? The answers to all of these questions will affect the scale of a project and the time it will take to implement.]
You quickly begin to see that there are many different ways you can slice up a big idea. And any one of these decisions could potentially blow your project up and make it unwieldy. Start small, and, remember – a project that is all things for all people is probably nothing for no one.

That checklist I gave you before is actually a pretty common one, and this visualization probably seems like common sense. But I still think it’s powerful to see laid out like this. Take a moment to look at it. [Sidebar: pause for a moment] Where do you think you want to live? [Sidebar: the answer is top left] Where do you want to avoid? [Sidebar: the answer is bottom right.] And of course you will probably spend most of your time in the top right. Not too difficult to tell that because this visualization gives you helpful names for each category.
This sort of task-oriented thinking isn’t something we’re used to doing. But it’s helpful to think about your work this way. Even something as abstract as writing can benefit from this! In my own situation – I’m a full-time, 12-month, 40-hour staff person, but I still try to write, publish, and (as you can see) give talks. Trying to finish writing projects when you have the regular standing commitments of a job is difficult. I only have so many hours in the workweek. Methods like these help me to figure out how long I have to write, what I can accomplish, and what I can’t.
[Sidebar: I want to give huge credit to Ronda Grizzle here for everything she does for the Lab related to project management. Everything I know about it I learned from her. Anandi also had wonderful thoughts on project management during this portion of the workshop, and she shared them with the students.]

One last quote on this that I want to leave you with. “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” Saying no is a super power. Truly. I’ve said in the Scholars’ Lab before that the best projects – the best features – are the ones you don’t implement. Because saying no to something in the short-term means that, in the long-term, you can say yes to something you really want to do.

[Sidebar: I set aside time here, again, for any questions or discussion that might come up.]
The next question is a big one for students. What kind of support do you have? It’s one thing to talk about the difficulties of project development in theory, but it’s another to come up against the actual realities of project development. You all have lives. You have programs you’re trying to do. This is hard. But the good news is that you’re not alone.

[Sidebar: Pepper being supported, cats, etc. etc. It was also about this time that Sarah and I agreed we would not get to the follow-up activities I had planned. Instead, the new plan was to finish out the talk portion, discuss with the students, and describe the kinds of activities we would have done with more time so that they could follow up with them on their own later. This revised plan meant that I didn’t feel the need to rush through the material - I could instead allow the students space for discussion as they wished.]

For one, I wanted to point you a blog post put out by the MLA Committee on Information Technology on how to begin thinking about putting together a digital dissertation. There are a number of good resources linked here that I would encourage you to check out. Guidelines for evaluating digital work. Models of work that has already been done. Any difficulties you might face from the standpoints of project development, of getting buy-in from your committee, or of dealing with the university have probably been faced by others before you. It is highly unlikely you are the first ones to have these issues. So look for evidence, help, support, and resources from the larger community. I’m happy to help you find things as well. Feel free to reach out.

I’m also certain there are people locally – students, staff, librarians, and faculty – who are in your corner. Sarah has already told me about some of them, and you already mentioned others in your introductions. Accept their help - you don’t have to do this alone. But be careful you don’t take exploit their goodwill.
Instead, I would encourage you to think of this work as an opportunity to start to develop a space more like what you would want the academy to be. This is an image of the Collaborators Bill of Rights. Digital work takes many hands. Consider that labor. Share generously. Credit liberally. Make sure that everyone all the way down is acknowledged in your project, in as many places as you can. Consider how you can make these people your true collaborators if they are up for it – ask them how they want to be cited. If their voice and work are important to you and your project, ask them if they want to co-present or co-author with you. These things might seem weird, trained as we are in the humanities to think of authorship as something done by sole individuals, but that doesn’t have to be the norm. And I can assure you that these conversations mean the world to people in libraries.
This conversation is not just about projects. It’s about people. And you can use this space to begin to help shape a more expansive, generous, and humane way of doing digital work. In the Scholars’ Lab, for example, we push for real collaborations. We do work with – not for – as much as we can. So begin to think about how your project, in some small way, can begin to flatten the hierarchies at work in the academy. If you were interested in a related document about rights you should expect of collaborations as a student, I’d also point you to the Student Collaborators Bill of Rights from UCLA.
[Sidebar: I paused again for questions.]

One tool we use in the Scholars’ Lab to help structure relationships in positive, ethical ways is called a charter. The charter is the last concept that I wanted to introduce to you all. It’s a pretty simple idea – a charter is a document that reflects your shared values and principles. What you expect of each other, how you’re going to work together. What you hope to get out of the thing. Think of it like a personal and collective mission statement.
A charter is something that a group can return to later when questions come up. Articulating values like this can be really useful because when the rubber hits the road you can ask of any new feature, project, or idea - does this connect with the things I care about? Is it advancing our mission, or at least our mission as we want to see it? In front of you is the charter for our first Praxis cohort. We’ve had students on this collaborative fellowship put a charter together every year, and we have several for the lab as well – one for the lab in general and another for how we approach student programs.
The reason I end with the charter is that it connects to what I might offer as a last principle for project planning.

A project is only as good as it connects to you. But you have to decide what that connection looks like.
We encourage our students to think about charters as an opportunity to articulate their project goals and also their goals for their own portion of the project. Their goals for themselves. What do they hope to gain? How do they hope to grow? What do they acknowledge as their own limitations? A project should, in some way, help you in your life. It’s going to get you to a place you want to be, be that professionally, spiritually, intellectually, or ethically. I thought of my dissertation as a story that I wanted to sit with and a story I wanted to tell for a few years. This is similar to how my colleague Jeremy Boggs describes digital archives and digital projects more generally. To him, projects tell stories. Put another way, how is your project going to help you tell yours? Or more specifically – what kind of person do you want to be? How can the telling of your project’s story help you to bring that person into reality? One answer might be as simple as “this content is important to me.” Another could be “I want to become closely connected with the librarians I work with and learn about their lives.” It could mean that you’re aware of the climate of the academic job market, and you’re using this as an opportunity to develop skills and expertise that can help you in a wide variety of careers.
A project is more than just the stuff - the disciplinary material - in it. It’s a statement about how you view your work and the world and how you think each should be. That’s why there’s a blank line at the end here. You have to decide what that last line is for yourself.

To tip my own hand a little bit, I wanted to speak just for a moment about how I see my pedagogical work and the project underlying it. I had this quote by Paulo Freire in mind as I was writing this talk. “As beings programmed for learning and who need tomorrow as fish need water, men and women become robbed beings if they are denied their conditions of participants in the production of tomorrow.” Sean Michael Morris shared this quote with us at Digital Pedagogy Lab a few weeks ago, and it’s been on my mind ever since.  There is a lot there, but Freire is getting at a few things. For Freire, education should always be a radical act of revolution. Students should always be thoroughly engaged in the process of shaping their own learning experiences, and it is the job of the progressive educator to help them overturn traditional modes of education and allow them to act as teachers themselves. The quote is about what does or does not help students produce their own tomorrows, but it’s also about producing the tomorrows of education and society.
I try to approach all the projects I work on – and really the students are the projects – with a sense of this animating philosophy in mind. I always want to ask, “how is what I’m doing here empowering students to reshape the structures that are holding them back?” There can and should be a reason for everything that I do, and I’m constantly thinking about what that reason is.
That’s where I’m coming from. That’s how I fill in that empty line. And I want you to think about that why question for yourselves. It’s not just a why for the content. But also about the why behind all the steps of project planning. How can your work help engineer the tomorrow you want to see?
So I want to end today by helping each of you engage in some soul searching. With the time we have remaining, we’re going to run a series of exercises and discussions about the kinds of goals and assumptions you’re bringing to this. And we’ll talk things out – I’m happy to spend more time addressing specific questions as well. We can go anywhere you want. Let’s get started.
[Sidebar: as I mentioned above, we didn’t actually have time to run the workshop proper, and we instead used the remaining moments for more discussion. I shared the slides with the folks who invited me, because they thought they might make for useful follow-up activities throughout the year. So even though we didn’t get to them, I thought I’d share the materials below with a few quick notes on what I had in mind. I’ll quit with the brackets, as the talk proper has ended. What follows is all just framing for the extra material I had prepared.]
Workshop Activities to Get You There
The preceding talk and discussion aimed to get the students thinking about their projects from a number of different angles - practical, logistical, collaborative, and theoretical. But I ended with values because, to me, they’re the most important. They can also be the most difficult to think about. It takes practice to learn how to articulate your values and goals in relation to a project, a measure of self-reflection that we aren’t necessarily taught how to do in graduate school. The following activities are meant to build on each other and guide participants towards a firmer sense of themselves in relation to their projects.
I also want to explicitly note the importance of the work of two people to the shape of these activities. Ronda Grizzle is the expert in the Lab on project management, charters, and life design, and I adapted the mind mapping activity, in particular, from work she has had us do internally. Secondly, I attended Digital Pedagogy Lab over the summer, and Sean Michael Morris’s breakout session on writing about teaching was instrumental in changing how I thought about in-class writing activities. I learned the four rules for writing from him in that session.
There are three activities I had planned. Given the title of the talk, I suppose I might call them “three activities to get you there”:

Charter discussion
Mind mapping
Timed writing on values

I’ll contextualize each activity briefly and share the slides that I had prepped. Hopefully that will give a sense of how I’d run them if others are interested.
Charter Discussion
Charters can be somewhat difficult to wrap your head around without models. So I planned to begin by offering the students some examples drawn from past years of the Praxis program. I shared the link for praxis.scholarslab.org/charter with the students, and from there I planned on doing a pretty typical think-pair-share activity. None of the charters are especially long, and it’s not necessary to read through one in its entirety to get the flavor of the piece. I anticipated having each student pick a charter to spend five minutes reading and thinking about. After the initial thinking time, they would spend five minutes discussing with their neighbor before we came back for a general discussion for ten minutes or so. The goal was to give the students models and to show them the kinds of categories that might go into such a document. Hopefully from there they would start thinking about personal, professional, and technical values they might have alongside their goals for the year.
The relevant slide:

Mind Mapping
After looking at charters from other groups, the students are ready to start thinking more deeply about their own views on things. For that, I turn to mind mapping.
Mind mapping is an activity that asks people to free associate words related to a particular topic in in the service of opening up a free, non-judgmental space for brainstorming. The first challenge with mind mapping, I find, is that people don’t necessarily know what it is. So several of the following slides focus on setting up the concept for participants.


The definition and example mind map I offer here come from a book Ronda Grizzle shared with me called Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. After offering a definition, I describe the general process, which involves a starting word, mapping out associations to that word, and then mapping out further secondary associations from there.

Images help to explain this better, I think, so I offer a picture of an example mind map from Designing Your Life, where someone is trying to brainstorm a potential career from things that interest them.

Next I suggest some reasons for mind mapping. By getting all of your ideas on the table, the process allows you to reflect more fully about which pieces are important to you. At the end of the mapping process, circling four or five of the words most important for you will help clarify which elements could be the basis for a good charter.

The starting word in the center of the map is important, as it generates the other associations for you. So I planned on reiterating the questions that we discussed in the course of discussion to help the students get started and to help generate other associations.

From there, the mind mapping activity involves the following:

Placing your starting word.
Mapping outwards for five minutes.
Reflecting on the resultant map for five minutes and circling important concepts.
Discussing with their neighbor for five minutes.

I’ve done a version of this activity for helping people develop a sense of their DH pedagogy, and I’ve found that mind mapping is great for helping participants engage in deeper forms of self-reflection about their everyday practices.
Timed Writing on Values
Now that the students have seen some examples and discussed them, it’s time for them to write. They’ll be in a decent place to do so, hopefully, because the mind mapping activity already asked them to think about large topics that were meaningful to them. As writing about values can sometimes feel frightening, I drew in Sean Michael Morris’s great rules for timed writing prompts here to help encourage the participants. I chose eight minutes, but you could give a longer amount of time - anything would be useful. After writing, I could imagine having a productive conversation about the results. The students need not feel pressured to share their exact wording, but a general discussion of the process, the issues, and things that they gravitated towards would be useful.

That’s it for the workshop and accompanying materials! Happy to talk with anyone who might be interested in working with them. The trip to Emory was very invigorating and provocative, and I was endlessly impressed, especially, by the students at ECDS. They’re a great crew. Keep an eye out for them - they’re already doing important work, and you’ll be hearing from them soon.

This week I’m at Digital Pedagogy Lab 2019, where I’m taking a course on Critical Open Pedagogy from Rajiv Jhangiani. For one of our prompts today, he asked us to respond to a post of his on 5 Rs for Open Pedagogy. The goal was to get us to reflect a bit on the values that bring us to the open space as well as the kinds of values that we bring with us. I think the aim was to come up with a concise, listicle style, but I didn’t quite follow that format. If I had to extract five verbs to describe what I write below about open pedagogy, they might be:

Care
Value
Share
Empower
Critique


The prompt and Rajiv’s post make me think of Erin Rose Glass’s incredible notion that if you stacked up all the papers written in all the courses in the world each semester they could reach the moon. Along with the image, she offers the provocative notion that those notes will all be thrown away at the end of the term. It’s an image to which I often return.
All that paper. All those ideas. All those people.
One of the things that brings me to open pedagogy is the idea that our students have something to contribute to the world. They are capable of good, complex thought, even about material that they are approaching for the first time. This is a belief about their ideas, but it’s also a comment on their value as people. In short, a degree is not necessary to prove your worth or your ability to think. A student’s thoughts are just as worthwhile as those of their teacher.
Open pedagogy is a practice that encourages us to think of student work as work, of student ideas as ideas. Students can change the world if we don’t get in the way. Instead of throwing their ideas away, we should approach them with care and attention.
But.
The world is a terribly risky and dangerous thing, a risk disproportionately shared by different groups of students based on identity and background. We cannot ask students to work in the open without pause. The task of the teacher is to help guide students in this space and to give them agency over their presence in it. To care and to steward, to collect and to distribute. But also to concede and to critique. To grant the right to be forgotten, as Tara Robertson reminds us. To allow for opting in as well as out.
Open is not universally good or universally available. A critical open pedagogy recognizes the limits and risks of open and educates students about this space so that they can be productive citizens of it if they so choose.
For me, then, open pedagogy is not just about distributing those pages rather than tossing them. It’s about taking them down from the stack and helping their author to think before throwing them away, even if they wind up deciding it’s necessary to do so.
Because it’s not just about the paper - it’s about the one who did the writing.

I was on a roundtable at ACH 2019 on The Life of a Lab, described on our slides as discussing “Cross-sectional issues of administration, funding, identity, and disciplinarity in DH labs.” The rough text of my talk follows along with my slides.

I’m Brandon Walsh, the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, a center for experimental scholarship in the University of Virginia Library, where our work is informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage. We are a part of and report through the library, and all but one of our employees are currently on hard salary lines. There’s much more to be said about nitty gritty things, and I’m happy to speak further in conversation with others about the Lab’s positioning and infrastructure. For now, I’ll just offer thoughts on this conversation from my own corner of our work, which is primarily student-driven and pedagogically inflected. The points I’ll raise aren’t ones we have the answers to necessarily, but they’re the work that we’re trying to think through.

I want to begin by situating my ideas in our space. This is a fisheye view of our public area (photo credit to Shane Lin), where students, faculty, and staff can collaborate on projects or get access to certain software packages (particularly GIS). It’s one of a few spaces we have, and we share it with the library and the public. Our makerspace is nestled in the back there, and any given day we have a number of people working there, some formally affiliated with us, some not. In the Lab we often say we prioritize building up people over projects. This positioning - this space that people move in and out of - both reflects and informs our philosophy in the Scholars’ Lab, which I’ve broken down here into a short list of points. Think of them as things I’d be likely to print out and pin to my wall as reminders/precautions/aspirations. Because of my own role, my remarks will largely deal with students.

Point 1: A lab’s community changes over time.
The life of a lab is one that waxes and wanes, that has lifecycles like any living thing. The Scholars’ Lab has a charter that expresses our values, but half of the people who wrote that document (one that is still very important to us) don’t work in the lab anymore (we’ll hopefully be renewing and rewriting soon). In the context of student work, one thing we think a lot about is how the community we give most of our resources to is necessarily going to leave (former Director Bethany Nowviskie has great reflections on this in her post “Too Small to Fail”). That’s not a problem per se. But it does lead to a difficult ebb and flow of outreach. It’s difficult to establish an identity on such shaky territory, and, yet, we’re nevertheless regularly called upon to do so. Life is about change.

Point 2: Community definitions include – and exclude.
We recently had something of a reckoning with our own identity as a digital humanities center - I think our reputation is largely as a DH center, but only about a third of our staff identified as DH. We’re still trying to reckon with this, but you caught a glimpse of it in how I defined what we do at the beginning of the talk. These definitional issues draw boundaries for people, and administrative choices can more explicitly delimit your community in exclusionary ways. From the student side of things, we work extensively with graduate students, but less so with undergraduates. MA students have a more difficult time finding their way into our named programs, and humanities-minded students in the sciences, architecture school, and others have bureaucratic difficulties to working with us. They still can, but the occasions are different. Much of my energy these days is spent trying to be more inclusive and inviting, both in abstract ways but also by dealing with red tape that throws up real barriers for people.

Point 3: A diverse community requires varied types of support.
Those different groups I mentioned? They all have different circumstances. MA students and PhD students, for example, all have different lived realities, positions in the university, goals, and needs. We’re constantly thinking about what meaningful units of support are – course credits, wages, stipends to offset teaching requirements. But there are also other things that are meaningful – help with professional development, emotional support, showing up for their dissertation defenses, etc. All of these things matter, but they matter in different ways to different people (and they cost different things to us as staff). This cuts across different areas of work as well. You can’t think about just one public or just one student body or just one monolithic Faculty with a capital F. It’s important to work across all these categories.

Point 4: Community members will leave.
A variation of point one. We do a disservice to our students and our community members if we are not thinking about what comes next for them. For our staff, it means encouraging professional development and recognizing that if they leave to go on to better things that means we’ve done our job well. For colleagues in precarious positions it means trying to advocate for the best possible circumstances for them we can, working against toxic systems that place them in such positions, and elevating their work and voices. For students in the Scholars’ Lab, this means engaging with a program called PHD+ that tries to prepare students for diverse career outcomes after graduating. It means having frank conversations with them about precarious labor in academia and in DH.

Point 5: We can always be better.
How can we be better? That’s the animating question that has been hovering behind all my comments so far and that drives my thinking on our student programs. For me, this means consistently re-reading and re-consulting the Postdoctoral Bill of Rights and the UCLA Student Collaborator Bill of Rights as touchstones for what we do. And groups like AADHum and DH-WoGeM are doing so much to elevate important conversations that we try (and will keep trying) to bring into our work in the lab. There are systemic forces structuring the way we interact with our community - and the way you interact with yours. Pushing back against them should be part of the long-term plans for a lab’s work. Even if things seem to be going well in a general sense, someone in your community is struggling.
Because talking about the life of a lab is really secondary to talking about the life -the lives - in a lab. We have a responsibility to do right by those people whom we teach, employ, collaborate with. This means approaching issues of infrastructure and administration with a sense of the lived impact these decisions have. We can always be better - there is always work to be done. That’s the work that we’re engaged in right now in the Lab.
I’m happy to talk more. For now I’ll yield to the rest of the group.

I’m a musician in my life outside of work, and one of my goals in the coming year is to explore the ways in which this part of my identity might intersect with my professional life as a DH teacher and researcher. I’m still working out what this looks like, but, for now, I’m exploring how critical making can give me a clearer sense of the technologies involved in musical production.
One thing I’ve been working on is the Pedal-Pi - a kit for building a guitar pedal that runs off a Raspberry Pi Zero. I picked this kit because it comes with just about every component you need to get going, as opposed to some other models that provide you with a shopping list but leave you to do the ordering (these options wound up being much more expensive all told). I’m interested in this project for a few reasons. For one, I don’t really have much sense at all of how electronics work or how the stuff I’m doing with an instrument gets processed into a digital format. For another, this pedal is pretty customizable. It comes with a variety of scripts written in C that you can use for effects out of the box, and I know just enough about programming to want to poke around under the hood of the thing.
Ammon ordered two kits for me in case I messed one up, which, as I describe below, turned out to be prophetic. Below is a short, bulleted list of reflections on the process so far.

The electronics (mostly) aren’t the problem. When I first started soldering, I was terrified I would mess something up, so I went slowly to make sure I didn’t set things on fire. Ironically, the first major issue I encountered had nothing to do with the electronics portion of the project. The issue was that I just wasn’t paying attention. Even after mentally repeating to myself again and again “OK A, B, and C get soldered into X, Y, and Z,” I still accidentally soldering something into hole D. It was reassuring to find that the main difficulties with the project were human. If you look closely at the C12 circle here you can see the remnants of the solder from where I put a component in the incorrect hole.
  

Like anything else, you get better with practice. I put a couple hours of work into the first pedal before I made the above mistake and shifted gears to start working on the backup kit. With that experience under my belt, I watched a couple soldering videos online to improve my technique. I was surprised to find that most of my bad results were because because I was too afraid. In most cases, I hadn’t applied enough heat to either the board or the component to get the solder to flow and connect well. The moral here - fear might be the mind-killer, but it also makes for some pretty lousy solder joints. I moved several times more quickly on the second pedal, and my work looked a lot better. I also started to compartmentalize the process a little. Rather than soldering one thing, checking my progress, and moving on, I would get several components in place before soldering them all at once. This process was a lot quicker, easier, and more effective. But it required me to have a little more confidence. Could always be better, but check out the joints on the second, improved pedal.
  


Even with electronics you can correct mistakes. Once I soldered a component in the wrong hole, I thought that the pedal was hopeless. But Shane showed me how to use desoldering wick, a material used to draw out unwanted solder, so that we could correct my error. We were able to heat the solder again and pull out the component that was in the wrong place, but that hole remained filled in. In order to clear the hole so that I can put new components in it, I’ll need to get a finer tip for our soldering iron. But I was surprised how many of the decisions we were making - actions that felt permanent - could still be undone. At one point, Shane went over a number of my joints on the first pedal and reshaped them for stronger and more conductive connections. I think I had this view that a circuit either worked or did not, and I was impressed with how a little tinkering could help you move between categories. I’m certain there are limits to all this, but I was surprised just how much flexibility you have.


People out in the world were having the same issues I was. The instructions for the Pedal-Pi are pretty thorough and helpful, but there was at least one spot where they seemed to assume a degree of familiarity with DIY electronics that I did not possess. In most cases, the instructions do a great job of letting you know when particular components have polarities that require them to be soldered in place in particular directions. One piece, however, didn’t mention anything about orientation being meaningful. The board uses two IC sockets, and there is a small dimple on one side of each socket to let you know the direction you should place them in. Presumably, this is a thing that those more familiar with circuits would just know. I checked online, though, and I was not the first person to have soldered a dip socket incorrectly. Allegedly, so long as I remember which socket is in backwards and adapt accordingly the board should operate fine. Again, I was happy to know I wasn’t the only one out there making mistakes. The reversed socket is at position U2 in this photo.
  

Sound and physical objects. The work in the makerspace has been interesting for the ways in which it has connected me with all the physical aspects of the music process. While it’s an oversimplification, I’ve sometimes thought of my work with music as ephemeral. When you paint something, you have a physical thing. If you sculpt something, you have a physical product. These physical objects persist. But a performance is tied to a particular time and place. Working on the guitar pedal has made me reflect on how my instruments are the product of centuries of engineering. So much making went into configuring my trumpet to help it sound just so, and music making is a deeply physical act. The electronics work in the makerspace has made me want to think more about all the different components of the pipeline, about the ways in which hardware and software affect the production of a musical experience.
  

Stay tuned for further reflections on this makerspace work in the future - I have one or two things to work out before I’m able to finish the pedal and start tinkering with effects. I’m looking forward to making some noise.

One thing I’ve realized about the Praxis Program, our year-long, soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities for a cohort of doctoral students, is that it changes each year. In my first year here, these changes were a source of anxiety for me. Surely, I thought, there must be a way to systematize the program, to find a format that would be more consistent, and, thus, more sustainable. Over the last two years, however, I’ve come to view these regular tweaks as a strength of the program. Rather than being locked into what we’ve done in the past, we’re committed to re-examining our assumptions and our plans. To illustrate this, I’d like to share an example of a problem we identified and some the ways we tried to address it during the past year.
At the end of every program, we run exit surveys with students and hold debrief conversations among the staff involved. Last year’s discussions brought up an important issue: for all of our talk about how the program is meant to be a curricular intervention in graduate studies and offer on-the-ground, hands-on training in the practical work of digital humanists, we were framing that work almost exclusively in the context of research projects. Our students left without much of a sense of digital pedagogy and what that might mean to them. Even though we encouraged students to document their process as the year went along, our emphasis on producing a digital project suggested that the work of a digital humanist is primarily project development. That might be true for a certain kind of digital humanities work, but it also leaves out so much of what these careers entail. By focusing our work in this way, we, and the students, seemed to be ignoring the strengths of the program as a teaching exercise itself.
Having identified this issue, we decided to spend a month or so of the following year’s program working on a new unit that I would construct on digital pedagogy. In addition to introducing the topic, part of our goal was to create a space for other kinds of outcomes for the year. Rather than having a single group project be the primary takeaway, I wanted our students to start thinking about the year as a portfolio of experiences with lots of different materials they could point to as their own. This addition would also help address one issue we’ve consistently found with the group project - by its very nature, it involves a degree of compromise from each student in the group. If the project feels too far afield from an individual student’s research agenda, it can be difficult to sell them on why they should remain engaged in the collective work. Expanding the range of results for the students also gave us new opportunities to create moments that would speak directly to the students’ individual research interests in a clearer way than we had in past. The whole sequence took place in four sessions.
Session One - Workshopping a Workshop
I called the introductory session to the digital pedagogy unit a “Workshop on Workshops,” a title that I took from a piece Zoe LeBlanc and I have coauthored for the forthcoming #DLFTeach Toolkit. That upcoming piece shares the spirit of what follows here, though with a different practical and theoretical framing. Keep an eye out for that volume, which should be dropping soon.
The assignment I gave the students was, over the course of a month, to create the structure for a ninety-minute digital humanities workshop related in some way to their own research interests. They certainly weren’t expected to know everything about the topic, but they could learn just enough to teach - just enough to teach to learn themselves. And, in an attempt to introduce them to a particular form of pedagogy that I tend to traffic in, I asked their workshop be a “low-tech, pencil and paper (ish) digital humanities workshop.” In terms of actual, tangible outcomes, at this stage I just asked they work towards having a blog post-length pitch with the idea, framing, and beginning skeleton for their session. They didn’t need to plan enough to actually give the workshop (yet! stay tuned, dear reader), but I wanted evidence that they had made significant progress in that direction. And the plan was that throughout the month we would workshop their materials together.
I suggested pencil and paper as a constraint by way of a reading we gave the students: “Beyond Buttonology: Digital Humanities, Digital Pedagogy, and the ACRL Framework” by John E. Russell and Merinda Kaye Hensley. The students read the piece, and we then opened the discussion with this quotation from it:

Knowing how to upload texts into a tool like Voyant does not help researchers think about what texts should be uploaded, how selecting data relates to a research question, or even what constitutes an effective research question.

The challenge for the students was to take seriously the provocation of the article, to get beyond workshops geared towards interfaces and tools (beyond buttonology) and towards concepts and methods. In doing so, I hoped, the students would realize that they could effectively approach and teach complicated digital humanities concepts as newcomers, even if they might be otherwise unfamiliar with the tools that might often be used to address these research questions. Learning about the former would hopefully mean they felt more comfortable exploring, evaluating, and recommending these tools to others. After introducing the concept of buttonology, we reflected on past technology workshops we had attended. What did good teaching look like in those contexts? What did less successful teaching look like? Was buttonology a concept or experience they had encountered before, even if they did not have a name for it?
We then got specific. In order to set the stage for this exploration, I modeled an example workshop for them by giving an introduction to sentiment analysis using pencil and paper. I’ve written about this particular workshop at length, so I won’t fully rehash the approach. Suffice it to say that I introduced the concept of sentiment analysis, asked the students to mark up by hand a passage for positive and negative polarity, and then used the resultant discussion to surface many of the underlying, humanistic issues with the methodology.
I’ve taught versions of this workshop in a number of contexts, but the difference here was that I approached it like something of a supervised laboratory experiment. I gave the workshop as normal, but I also described the theoretical and practical reasons behind my pedagogical choices as they took place in real time. It felt a lot like I was running two workshops simultaneously - the first was an introduction to text analysis, and the second was a higher-level conversation on the pedagogical environment and experience I conducted as I went. After the workshop ended, we took a few minutes to reflect on the teaching together. We talked about the advantages (discussion based, little room for technological failure) and disadvantages (difficult to connect it back to things they could immediately use) of the approach.
This mix of practical experience and theoretical reflection would come to be crucial in the coming months as we continued the exercise. With this initial workshop as a model, I challenged the students to aim for a similar outcome of their own from the unit. To get to that point, the following sessions would walk the students through a series of scaffolded exercises meant to draw them from point A to point Z. The follow-up assignment leading into the next session was for the students to reflect on their own, discipline-specific research interests. The students need only do some soul searching and come in with two or three large interventions that their dissertation projects made or, if they weren’t at that point in their programs yet, that they were interested in exploring as graduate students.
Session Two - General research interests
When we reconvened, we asked questions of each other to learn more about our individual research interests, and we offered some points of connection to larger digital humanities topics. By now the students had begun to gather some sense of the larger field, so they had developed the ability to say things like “You’re interested in textual editing? That reminds me of TEI, which we learned about a couple weeks ago.” They might not have felt prepared to go much deeper, but that was fine at this stage. I just wanted them to get things on the table.
In preparation for our next session, I asked the students to explore Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments, a fantastic collection of different activities and statements drawing from a wide variety of different areas. I often suggest the collection as an entry point for people interested in learning about DH but who haven’t found their own clearly defined entry point yet. With an eye to their own stated research interests, I asked them to select one or two sections of the volume to explore at length.
Session Three - General DH interests
In this session, we used the Digital Pedagogy volume as a bridge to help narrow each student’s focus within digital humanities. We went around the table and had each student share what they had explored and how it related to their research interests. We started to broach basic questions of pedagogy as well - what could they imagine being engaging to students about the topic? What would likely be difficult to grasp? How might the students address these issues?
Besides offering each of them a chance to think about their own interests, sharing and workshopping for each other meant that the students were also getting a lot of exposure to areas beyond their own interests. Our fellowship cohorts have six people in them, so they were getting a crash course in five topics outside their own field. This general approach guides much of Praxis - we frequently pair a deep dive into one subject or method with broad exposure to a variety of areas. The follow-up work from this session was to continue to narrow. The students had moved from disciplinary interests to DH areas, and now I wanted them to take the final step. I asked them to think through how they would teach something about this subject area to newcomers.
Session Four - Specific, Teachable DH Workshop Ideas
In the last session, the students shared their specific ideas for introductory digital humanities workshops with the group and offered feedback for one another. I continued to broach pedagogical issues, but the students were also quite good at flagging potential problems for each other. They gave strong feedback and asked good questions of each other:

What were the goals of the session?
What seemed the most challenging for the instructor? What were potential pitfalls?
Does the instructor seem to be planning too much?

With this feedback in mind, the students had one last chance to re-conceive of their work before delivering what, at the time, felt like their final outcomes. Several of the students wound up posting their workshop ideas to the blog. If you’re interested in seeing what they came up with check out the posts below:

Sounding Scholarship: A Workshop on Making Your Research Sing
String Theory, or: Let’s Explore Social Networks with String!
Teaching Transcription (and Secretly Metaphysics)

A general interest in networks in early American history found its way into a workshop on network analysis using string and rope. An interest in textual criticism lead to a workshop on digital editing and transcription. This certainly isn’t the only or best way to introduce students to digital pedagogy. I’ve already prepared a few changes for next year, including asking students to read more theory and readings to go along with the work they’re developing. But, all in all, I think the unit on pedagogy was a success. We had new conversations that hadn’t been a part of Praxis in the past, and it felt as though the shift towards teaching brought out the voices of students who were quieter at other parts of the process. The students also came away with a professionally legible piece they could add to their portfolios, and I felt they were better able to speak to the pedagogical intervention the program itself was trying to make.
As I had originally conceived it, the unit on digital pedagogy ended there. But it turns out the students were really excited about the work they had done and wanted to actually teach the workshops for a live audience. We wanted to honor that energy, so we unexpectedly gave the digital pedagogy unit a second life in the spring semester. I’ll write a second post that will describe that real-life road-testing soon.

When I sat down to write this post I had no ideas. That’s probably inevitable, given the year of blogging challenge that we’re undertaking in the Scholars’ Lab. The whole point is to write often and frequently, that there is value in a steady stream of thoughts rather than waiting for the perfect blog post, and that regular writing makes the whole thing easier. Still, all those good intentions didn’t help me as I struggled to put text to blank page. As I often do in those situations I got out a deck of cards and started playing.
I’ve been obsessed with Oblique Strategies for years now. If you’re not familiar, Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards published by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt that aims to offer short, pithy suggestions for getting around creative dilemmas. The idea behind them is that the serendipity of drawing a mysterious phrase from the deck will help disrupt any blocks you might have moving forward. I’ve got a stack of them that I keep on my desk, and it’s a comfort to know that I’ve always got a wrench to throw in the gears at any given time. This morning as I flipped through the deck for inspiration these were the cards that came up first:

When is it for?
Use an old idea
Turn it upside down
Once the search is in progress, something will be found
Humanize something free of error

A lot there! Surely, somewhere in there, I could find material for a successful blog post on digital pedagogy, the subject I’ve been trying to focus on with these regular posts. I did, and I could. But the activity interested me more: how could these cards - the idea of them more so than any one phrase on them - inform teaching within the field of DH more generally?
Of course, I’m not the first one to think about how Oblique Strategies might apply to DH. Mark Sample’s keynote for the first annual Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship took up this topic. In “Your Mistake was a Vital Connection: Oblique Strategies for the Digital Humanities,” Sample does a fantastic job articulating the potential for the deck to inspire digital humanities research and pedagogy. Sample advocates not just using the deck as a means to an end - he suggests making serendipity the process and outcome itself. The deck can be quirky way to step over difficulty and get back to the serious business of doing work, but it can also offer a reconsideration of what the work could look like in the first place.
Sample frames using Oblique Strategies in DH research and pedagogy as a question of embracing serendipity as a methodology. This seems to me to be right and correct, but his piece also makes me want to think further about how Oblique Strategies might offer ways for thinking through digital pedagogy in particular. Besides shuffling up any of those cards and thinking about any specific aphorism’s applicability to teaching in a DH context, what might a larger approach to digital pedagogy look like when informed by oblique strategies? Sample offers serendipity as a way into the question, but this is only one to think about the cards. After all, embracing chance as a methodology involves releasing something else - control.
Take the way Sample offers the same question I just posed: “How might oblique strategies not only be another way to work in general, but specifically, another way to work with the digital scholarship and pedagogy we might otherwise more comfortably approach head-on, as Brian Eno put it.” This reading frames use of the cards as a question of directionality but also of power - rather than assert power, the cards seem to say, give yourself over to the whims of chance, let your creative faculties engage, and step in from the side. In order to play the game as invited by Oblique Strategies, you have to first accept you might not have all the answers.
For me, this question of authority is the clearest link between the deck and how I might apply it in the DH classroom. For me, good digital humanities teaching is always about unsettling authority in the classroom. When digital humanists co-teach courses, they model how no one person has all the answers. When we encourage process and reflections on failure as important scholarly outputs, we encourage students to give themselves over to a more humane understanding of research. When we counsel students on imposter syndrome, we directly encounter the idea of the authority. There are more specific, personal implementations for me as well. When I run a class, I tend to ask more questions than I offer answers, and my ultimate goal is for the students to recognize that their own contributions to discussion can often be more valuable than mine.
All of this makes me want to ask: how can Oblique Strategies encourage a more student-centered pedagogy? How could we use the ethos of the cards to disrupt vectors of power in the classroom and create a more meaningful, inclusive teaching environment? What about this would be specific to digital pedagogy? In the spirit of what I’ve described above, I won’t offer answers (yours would be as meaningful as mine). Towards the end of Sample’s blog post he shares together a playful tool for generating your own oblique strategies for digital humanities. I thought I might take a similar approach, offering a few elliptical statements on how we might approach digital pedagogy obliquely in the aphoristic style of Oblique Strategies. I had originally intended to give brief glosses about how they might be interpreted, but I think that gets away from the spirit of the thing. In a riff on Wallace Stevens’ “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” I’ll give thirteen, lest any one appear to be more important than the others:
Thirteen Oblique Strategies for Digital Pedagogy

Create <-> consume
Analog digital
Interaction over interface
Displace authority
Questions
Allow for gaps
Process product
People first
Iterate
Cultivate imposterdom
Design Design
Can you fail?
Disrupt / connect

Of course, maybe the best oblique strategy would be to hand the students a blank deck with some colored pencils and ask them to draw for you.

As part of the Scholars’ Lab’s year of blogging, Amanda asked me to write a little about my pedagogy and things that have helped me find it. When someone asks me to do such a thing, I always think about a poll that Jesse Stommel put out on Twitter about pedagogical training in graduate programs. He asked:

Dear higher education teachers, a poll. Answer below, reply with stories, and pass along. How much training in teaching or pedagogy was/is included in your graduate program?

The majority of people responded to say their training amounted to “basically nothing.”
I consider myself in the “basically nothing” category as well. My program did have a single semester course for pedagogical training, but for a variety of administrative reasons, it was possible to slip through the cracks and start teaching without any formal training. This is not to say there was no teaching support - we did have the help of a faculty mentor while serving as a teaching assistant, and we graduate students had each other. But that kind of catch-as-catch-can approach to pedagogical training left me with what felt like a very spotty teaching background and loads of imposter syndrome.
So, in some ways, this post is a letter to myself from eight years ago. It talks about steps I’ve taken to develop a stronger sense of myself as a teacher. It’s worth noting at the outset here that teaching happens in many shapes and sizes - courses, workshops, weeklong institutes, one-on-one mentoring, etc. Similarly, your pedagogy itself manifests in a variety of different ways, but it should ideally inform every decision you make about yourself as a teacher, your students, and everything in between. It’s also worth noting that these steps are more truly about pedagogy generally - digital pedagogy is a related subject that overlaps with this one that merits its own discussion. But the steps below could certainly get you started thinking your way through a pedagogy in that field as well.
Hopefully, what follows will help someone else work their way towards a more informed, aware, and critical sense of their own pedagogy. I’m still learning, and these are the steps I’m taking to do it.
What’s a Pedagogy?
When I put together my first syllabus, I had no idea where to start. I didn’t even really know what the genre looked like, despite having seen syllabi many times before. So I collected a bunch of example syllabi from friends and looked at what others had done. Using these pieces, I started assembling a Frankenstein’s monster of a syllabus that, when I looked down, was eight pages long and had pages of policies, rules, and readings.
Do these sort of things inform your teaching? Sure. Are they your pedagogy? No…or not exactly. An important first step is recognizing something that Jim Seitz, UVA’s Director of Academic and Professional Writing, told me at a later date - your pedagogy is what arises out of your motivation and thinking behind every decision related to the classroom. Those rules and policies were not my pedagogy, but they were expressions of it. They reflected a variety of different ideas about who my students were, how I viewed the classroom, and how we would all be interacting with each other.
Of course, when writing that initial syllabus, I didn’t know anything about all this - I was grabbing pieces that felt right without thinking too much about them. At the end of it all, I remember looking down at the resulting syllabus and thinking, “It sounds like I’m going to run this class on film musicals like it’s a police state.” So I deleted 90% of the rules and policies and started over. There was a pedagogical reason behind my doing this, but I didn’t really know it at the time. For me, discovering my own sense pedagogy has been about reclaiming agency over these sorts of impulses. I’ve learned what I care about, what I don’t, and places where I can express my vision of what teaching should be.
How Do I Find Mine?
The first thing to know about teaching is that if you’re asking that question you’re already moving in the right direction. These steps can help.


Think about what you’re doing. You might not realize all the different components that go into the classroom, but every one of these could merit further examination. Everything from the way you dress to the way you interact with your students to whether you sit or stand while teaching can be things to think further about. Think about all the different elements that make up your teaching experience.


Recognize which of the things you’re doing are choices. Most teaching situations bring with them a variety of constraints. Depending on your situation, you might not be able to adjust certain elements of the classroom. Of course, these sorts of restrictions can still be worth examining more closely - you might not always be constrained in this way, and it can be useful to have deeper thoughts about what you’re doing even if you can’t change it.


Work from specific to abstract. Take a look at one thing you do and try to find the principle behind it. Given the entire world of possibility, what was it that would lead you to choose to do that one thing and not any others? And then take that justification and get even more abstract - why is it so important to you? To offer one example: when I run discussion I tend to contribute more questions than I do statements. As students respond to the questions, I give more. I do this because I’m genuinely interested in what the students have to say. And I think the underlying belief here is that students, even while learning, can make important contributions to complex discussions that are at least as important as anything I can offer.


Observe others teach. Growing up, you probably spent a lot of time in classrooms as a student. But the irony is that, once it became clear that you would do some teaching, you probably didn’t get much of a chance to see how others do it. Education programs generally have student experiences designed to address this gap, but I think it’s the case that graduate students in the humanities don’t get enough opportunities to observe others. And you can’t rely on your memories of what good and bad teaching looked like - it’s fundamentally different to be a student than to be an outsider thinking about the logistics of how it all gets put together. So ask others if you can watch them teach. While some people might be self-conscious about the activity, you’ll get some people willing to let you sit in on a class. And while you’re watching, take notes about everything from the students to the teacher to the general classroom environment. Everything can be grist for your mill.


Talk with others you respect about their teaching. This point can be taken in isolation, but it works best with observing someone teach. It often works well to get context for what goes on in a given classroom session. If the instructor has a lesson plan prepared in advance, ask them to send it to you (or at least a few sentences about what they’re planning to do). After the session, ask if you can follow up to talk about what you saw. Keep in mind that you’re asking the observee to do work for you. I sometimes offer to buy coffee to sweeten the deal if necessary, though this might not be financially possible for you. You might also offer to have them observe you in turn. When talking, it can often be a good entry point into the conversation to ask them how they thought the session went. And beyond observing individual classes, you should explore whether your institution (or one nearby if you don’t have one) has a group dedicated to teaching and pedagogy whose work and conversations you can tap into.


Read and learn more. Depending on your own background, this fact might get obscured, but pedagogy is an area of study - and research - like any other in academia. There are countless scholars working to advance conversations about pedagogy, and beginning to read around in the field can help you to discover where you fit in. You might start off by reading people discussing teaching as it relates to your specific field to get a general sense, but strong pedagogy frequently transcends the disciplines in which it manifests. As with any discipline, you won’t agree with everything you read. If you’re reading this, odds are you are in some way interested in how we run our student programs in the Scholars’ Lab. A pedagogical starter pack for us might include Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed, bell hooks’ Teaching to Transgress, Cathy Davidson’s The New Education, and L. Dee Fink’s Creating Significant Learning Experiences. As with any good lit review, I find it works well to read any given piece looking what I am going to read next. I’m always looking for my next citation. So as you’re going, keep an eye out for any compelling citations that might offer good opportunities for digging deeper into the conversation in the future.


Where to Start. You might try a thought experiment: imagine that your supervisor has asked you to take on a new course/workshop/student. In short, you’ll be doing exactly what you currently do but with one crucial difference - they will dictate everything about your teaching. Everything will be decided for you and you will have few freedoms. But they recognize your strengths as a teacher and are willing to compromise - you can bring three things over from how you used to teach. Only three - pick the most important parts of what you do. Start with the three treasured components, find the beliefs that underlie them, and you’ll be well on your way to developing a stronger sense of your pedagogy.


Hopefully the above activities will help someone reading this think more deeply about their teaching. The above suggestions are all born out of my own experiences with pedagogical training and growth - your mileage may vary. If you have had wildly different experiences I would love to hear more about them. My last suggestion is to write your pedagogy down. These writings might take many forms. The Scholars’ Lab has tried to express our pedagogy in the form of a charter. You might choose to blog about it or construct a generalized teaching statement, but, whatever form you choose, writing about your teaching will help you develop a better sense of it. And that labor is not for nothing - there are a number of great venues for writing about pedagogy, and doing so can be a professionally legible activity in its own right.
The world needs more teachers, and it needs more good thinking about teaching. Contribute yours to the conversation.

Alison Booth and I are co-teaching a graduate course this semester on Digital Literary Studies. As a part of the course, we’re having a series of technical workshops - command line, Python, text analysis, encoding, and markup. The scheduling worked out such that these workshops wound up being on Wednesdays, with the discussions of critical theory on digital humanities and literary method mostly on Mondays. That’s all fine and good, but I worried that neatly dividing the class out in that way would create a divide between the one day of the week when the students were actively discussing the material in the course and the other when they were mostly in hands-on workshops. Rather than having a hacking day and a yacking day, I wanted to see what I could do to create an environment for hack-yacking. So when I taught the first workshop on command line, I wanted to try something slightly different from what I normally do by making more room for discussion. I wanted to bring the Monday readings and conversations back into the Wednesday workshops.
Teaching programming well is very difficult. An easy, low-hanging fruit way to get the material across to your students is to connect your laptop and type in front of the students, explaining your keystrokes as you go and asking them to mirror your actions. Another approach I’ve seen (and used) uses slides to do something similar - sharing code examples and interspersing theoretical concepts as you go. Both of those approaches are all to the good, but they feel a bit too much like lecturing to me. I was trained as a teacher of English literature, which means that my bread and butter is the seminar. My approach to the discussion seminar has always been to act as something of a void in the center of the class, asking questions that get the students to engage with the material and each other more than with me. Lecturing has its place, I’m sure, but it generally makes me uncomfortable and doesn’t reflect the kind of pedagogy I value. So when teaching this workshop on command line I wanted to push myself a little more to see how much discussion I could incorporate into a technical skills workshop. How could I use this experience to help the students begin to think about technology as something that they could engage critically with? as something that was not so alien from their normal work of thoughtful, critical discussion?
My goals for the seventy-five minute session, then, were as follows:

Introduce the concept of the graphical user interface (GUI)
Introduce the concept of the command line
Give practice with the command line
Use the command line to do something that connected with the discussion we had been having elsewhere in the course

The overriding concern for me was to communicate the technical skills the students needed while not making it a “watch what I type” workshop. I wanted discussion and engagement to be the main priority.
To start off, I shared several different images of graphical user interfaces like this one.

I began by simply asking the students to describe what they saw, framing the activity as continuous with their usual practices of analyzing prose, poetry, or photographs. In the same way that any piece of a text or image can be interpreted and described, so too can technology be subjected to the same analysis. This component of the workshop was inspired by Erin Rose Glass. When she visited the Scholars’ Lab last semester for a talk on surveillance capitalism, she asked the audience to close read the Microsoft Word interface, and I thought the move did a great job of defamiliarizing an everyday piece of technology and subjecting it to critique. In this case, I asked my students a series of questions:

What kind of assumptions does the GUI make of its users?
What kind of an experience does it want you to have?
How does it structure that experience?
What kind of audience does it have in mind?

These provocations led to an interesting conversation about accessibility, design, and assumed expertise. I especially wanted the students to note how the GUI makes immediately apparent a range of options to the user. But those options are also limited. The interface sacrifices possibility for practicality, and it can never give you every possible option. This discussion set us up well for the next image I presented to them - a terminal window.

Again, I paused for discussion, asking questions that directed the students to the lack of clearly visible options in the terminal and how this suggested an assumption that its users would have a certain level of expertise. For better or for worse, it assumes that you know what you’re doing. I could have just told the students all this, of course, but I wanted them to arrive at these ideas themselves. So I mostly framed the activity with questions and helped to direct discussion, just as I would in directing close reading of a passage in a novel. In some small way, I hoped the activity would show them that the close reading and analytical skills they developed in other English classes would still be applicable here, even though the objects of study might be different and even though they might feel a bit at sea.
With some sense of what the command line was, the next phase of the workshop took the students through a variety of commands with the terminal. This component of the class felt the most like a typical introduction to the terminal in that I offered a command, executed it, and then we reflected on the results together. The commands we covered mostly focused on navigating the file system and adding or deleting files:

cd
ls
pwd
touch
rm
mkdir
cp
mv
man

Nothing too fancy or tricky. From a practical standpoint, the students needed to get the terminal under their fingers so that they’d be prepared to work with it for the rest of the course. As preparation for this piece, we had the students work through the Command Line Crash Course from Learn Python the Hard Way. So the workshop was not their first moment experiencing the terminal, and I could review these pieces quickly before trying to engage the students further.
One easy way to try to bridge the gap between our discussions of readings and our workshop on the terminal was to drawn in one of the texts that they had read and discussed in a previous session. Superficially, this meant that the students would at least have familiar thematic material in front of them - I selected an essay for us to work with by Katherine Bode titled “The Equivalence of ‘Close’ And ‘Distant’ Reading; Or, toward a New Object for Data-Rich Literary History.”
The students had been reading a cluster of essays about distant and close reading, and, for our last activity together, I wanted to defamiliarize the process of reading using the command line to further that discussion. The plan was to have our students use the terminal to “read” that article in a number of different ways. At each step along the way, we stopped to reflect on the kinds of reading enabled or inhibited by the commands.
I put the text of the article in question up on my website ahead of time so that they could easily access it. First I had the students use the curl command to copy down the text of a URL onto their computer (note that I’ve since taken this text down):
$ curl walshbr.com/materials/bode.txt

The curl command spits the text of this page onto their screen, which lead to an interesting conversation about this as a type of reading. I asked the students to characterize the kind of reading it did or did not seem to enable. For one, they noted the lack of an ability to paginate through the text, which seemed to imply that the command was meant for readers that planned to take in the text all at once. As in, curl might be meant for machines using a text as data rather than a thing to be read in a more humanistic sense.
To ensure that we all had the necessary materials, we grabbed that same text and sent it into a text file on our computer:
$ curl walshbr.com/materials/bode.txt > bode.txt

This simple command allowed us to talk about how to get web texts and pages onto your computer, gave us occasion to discuss those situations in which you would want to do so, and began a discussion about the kinds of reading possible in different interfaces for reading texts. We then moved along to a couple of different commands for getting text out of a file and onto your screen using the command line.
First, we got all of the text at once.
$ cat bode.txt

Second, we got a version that would allow us to proceed through the text page by page.
$ less bode.txt

These commands led to some good reflections on the embodied experience of paging through a physical book with your hands as opposed to using the space bar to do a similar activity. We also talked about the different kinds of reading that we might want to carry out, both in general and in digital literary studies. We don’t engage in texts the same way every time we use them, and these restrictive modes of reading foreground that. In one great moment, a student realized that he couldn’t get out of the interface created by the less command - “I can’t stop paging! I’m trapped in the text!”
From there, we used the terminal to search for particular words (the word “reading” in this case):
$ grep reading bode.txt

And then we counted the number of times a particular word occurred in our text:
$ grep reading bode.txt -c

By searching for particular words relevant to the themes of the text, we had a good discussion about the point at which characters and words on a page become meaningful. In particular, the students noticed that, for a computer, capitalization matters in a way that it does not for a human reading a document. They inferred the differences between tokens and types, the difference between any particular occurrence of a sequence of characters and that word as a unique vocabulary unit. In order to really find out how often the term “reading” appeared in the text, the students realized they would need to normalize everything by converting it to lowercase.
I’ve done workshops on the terminal in the past, but this was the first one where I tailored the commands we would be practicing to the subject-matter at hand. Besides the basics of how to interact with the file system, we really only worked with commands relevant to getting and examining textual data. The workshop helped the students come to an understanding that computers read quite literally, with no context or knowledge by default. Later on, the students would find these suspicions corroborated in a reading by Johanna Drucker on “Why Distant Reading Isn’t,” where she suggests that computational reading might be the closest reading of all. Using the terminal as a point of entry into those conversations meant that the students could find their own way to these concepts. In the future I’ll keep this sort of discipline-specific approach to teaching technical skills in mind. It worked well for making the material more immediately relevant and accessible to the students than it might have been otherwise.

Well, that’s a wrap. The fall semester is done, and 2019 is getting started. Actually, when I first started drafting this post the previous spring semester had just finished wrapping as well. This post has been sitting in my drafts folder since spring of 2018, so I wanted to try to push this out before another semester flew by.
At the end of the spring 2018 semester, the Praxis students presented reveal.scholarslab.org to an utterly packed house, which meant that the first full cycle of Scholars’ Lab student programs under my watch had taken place. It feels like I just got here, but, as I like to mark milestones, it felt worth reflecting on a few lessons from the last year (and then some). In addition, I’ve found myself often describing a few basic theoretical and practical tensions at the heart of our fellowship programs to anyone who is interested in what we do, so it seems worth writing down my thoughts on them in a wider, more public forum. This post, then, will aim to do both of those things by offering a bit of a glimpse into the history of one of our programs and the thinking behind it. In particular, I’ll talk about the line we try to walk between student-centered learning and project-centered learning. I’ll be talking about what Praxis works on each year and how we go about picking that project. Because, frankly, the questions about our programs that I’ve gotten most often over the course of the last year are “what are they?” and “what are they working on?”
Some background and practical considerations. The Praxis Program is just one of our fellowship programs each year, but, as it serves more students than our programs, I think it’s safe to say that it takes up the most mental energy of everyone in the lab. Each year, we take six humanities students from various departments around the University (this year we have our first Architecture School student!) and offer them a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities work. The fellowship asks for about ten hours of attention from the students each week in the form of a weekly meeting or two and collaborative work in a number of forms. The students are funded to participate in it by way of reducing their teaching obligations for the year - the students get time to learn and grow together as a result of the reduced course load. You can read more about the program on the project website, the DH abstract for the poster the team presented when the project first launched, or in this introductory post by Bethany Nowviskie. The program draws together several strands of pedagogical theory, a sampling of which might include Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed, the UCLA Student Collaborator’s Bill of Rights, or many of the writings of bell hooks.
We’ve published a pair of charters outlining the pedagogical obligations we feel towards our students, both in the Praxis program and in our programs more generally. (These charters didn’t exist when I first drafted this post in the spring of 2018. That’s one benefit of waiting seven months to finalize a post!) Check those documents out for general statements about our belief in public, process-driven pedagogy. But those statements won’t illuminate much about the day-to-day of what life is like for our students in our programs. Nor will they necessarily illuminate much about the logistics of how we carry out a fellowship year. So I thought I would share a little more about those specifics - what our students work on and how they get there. After all, the theory informs the doing, and the writing of those documents helped shape our programs this year.
One thing I’ve been thinking a lot about this year is the primary vehicle by which we facilitate the learning process in the Praxis program - the project. I usually put it this way: Praxis is a year-long fellowship that has a distinctive shift in feel between the fall and spring semesters. In the fall, there is still a fair amount of the Scholars’ Lab staff in the front of the class leading seminars or giving workshops to the students, as you might expect from a class where they will be learning a lot of digital methods. But we also share a range of strategies and techniques that aim to give a high-level look at all the different components of digital work - intellectual property, project scoping and management, collaboration planning, and way more (you can check out the common curriculum here). Most importantly, we help them think about what they’ll be doing together during the year: we help them design and scope a project that they’ll be working on in the spring, when we shift to much more of a hands-on, side-by-side, lab approach to the learning experience. While we still think a lot in the spring, our day-to-day work is mostly taken up working together to make the thing happen. We try to give the students power over the process all year long, but this is really evident in the spring when we put them in charge as much as possible.
Folks interested in Praxis often ask what the students are working on because, at the end of the day, people know that we want them to build something. But how they get to it has changed significantly over time. In another post by Nowviskie, she mentions that “It’s just too much to ask that students new to digital humanities work invent a meaningful project from whole cloth on Day 1 of the program — especially one that, we hope, will make a meaningful intervention in the current scene of DH research and practice.”
I think it’s worth sharing a little Praxis history here. (I should say at the outset of this discussion that, while I was a student in the second cohort of the program, I was never really privy to the pedagogical conversations that drove the fellowship. So take all of these observations from the outside with a grain of salt, except for the last year or so where I am happy to take any blame.) The compromise in the first few years was to give the students a piece of vaporware or a project already in progress and, within those restrictions, ask the students to make this kernel of an idea their own and to develop their own intellectual contribution based on it. The first Praxis cohort developed Prism, a digital version of a vaporware experiment in collaborative textual analysis and visualization developed by Nowviskie and SpecLab. The second cohort extended Prism, adding in new features based on their own interests and priorities, with the goal of taking the project from a proof of concept to a tool that was more open and usable. Accordingly, Prism has seen significant uptake, particularly in K-12 classrooms as a pedagogical tool for teaching a variety of reading and interpretive skills.
In its third year, the program took a similar approach to developing a project - the staff tasked the Praxis cohort with developing a new version of Ivanhoe, another older Scholars’ Lab project that was an exercise in collaborative interpretation and literary intervention, that would run as a WordPress theme. The following year, the fourth cohort of students redesigned Ivanhoe further to allow multimedia contributions.
So, in one sense, the first four years of the Praxis program were heavily directed - the core project was given, but the intellectual framing, stakes, and intervention itself were left to the students. Because of this, the students were saved the difficult task of making a from-scratch contribution to a field they were just learning for the first time. The students still maintained ownership of the project, but the initial guidance meant that the projects were able to go quite far for student projects. Each project ran on a two-year cycle, which meant that one cohort was tasked with the heavy lifting of developing a first pass at the digital project while the next would inherit the intellectual weight of conversations they hadn’t participated in. Each cohort got different glimpses of the lifecycle of a digital project.
The next three years were even more student-directed. The students still were given wide latitude over the kinds of skills they took away and the nature of the project that developed at the end, but different productive constraints were used to guide the work of the group. The staff stepped back a bit more in years five and six of the program and did not explicitly give a project to the students. Rather than being given an explicit project, the students were given an idea or topic. In each case, the students were told to think about the concept of time and develop a project that would intervene in our understanding of it. Naturally, the slightly more free-form approach meant that the students had the leeway to take wildly different approaches. The fifth cohort developed ClockWork, which used sonification to grapple with the monetary measurements of time. The sixth cohort took time as encouragement to think about social media as the best representation of the now, and these investigations led them to think about the social media ecologies of the Kardashian family. In the seventh year, my first in charge of the program, we stepped back even more, leaving off the time prompt for the students. We came in with a light plan but really followed student interests where they wanted to go, giving broad freedom over the direction of the program and the project. The result was UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University, a project that used augmented reality to layer contextual information onto public spaces to challenge public narratives of contested spaces. Ironically, even though time wasn’t the students’ focus, the project still deeply engaged in questions of the past, the present, and the stories we tell ourselves about both.
For the eighth, current year of the program we’ve instituted some significant changes to things that I will write more about in the future. But relevant to this discussion about freedom vs. constraint is that we returned somewhat to the roots of the program, providing the students with a fairly well defined kernel of an idea to make their own and implement in their own way. Students this year are working with the library’s Director of Information Policy to develop a project that engages with the ramifications of January 1st, 2019, when new works entered the public domain for the first time since the passage of the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act. I can go on about how excited I am for it, but I’d prefer for the students to frame the intervention themselves when they’re ready to do so. Keep an eye out for those insights!
Therefore, in answer to the question “What is Praxis working on?” I’d say: the students have worked on many different types of things over the years.
I think, however, that people ask what we’re engaged with presently not just to get a sense of the final product, but also in an attempt to better understand our process. Because no matter how public and transparent we try to be, the program is always happening for a small group of students behind doors that, if not closed, are cracked only slightly (we’re a library after all).
In that case, I have a slightly more boring answer to the question that I think really gets at the heart of the program.
What is Praxis working on?
We’re working on it.
The truth is we could have the students work on pretty much anything. The discussions would change, and the interventions into the scholarly conversations might be more or less incisive. But the built project is only part of the equation for us. And as the Scholars’ Lab charter states, the development of our people is at least as important as the projects or products themselves. The thing the students work on is less important than what that object can do in the service of the larger group. Our real aim is to build up the students as confident, conversant scholar-practitioners of digital method.
Praxis can be difficult to describe because it changes every year, and that’s by design. The content of the project changes, sure, and the students necessarily change. But the staff also changes - the lab has had a lot of turnover since Praxis began. I’m now the third or fourth person to take charge of Praxis, and we all have different ways of running things and conceptualizing the program. Rather than think of the program as a search for the perfect approach to project-based pedagogy, in the last year I’ve really come to see its evolving nature as a strength. When I’m asked what is Praxis working on, I’m led to think about how we’re constantly trying to reshape our fundamental assumptions, re-evaluating the process, and making changes based on the needs of our students. The staff are always working on the fellowship program itself.
Because process is everything. How we have students approach the work can really set the students up for success for failure-even more than the nature of the project itself. In the Scholars’ Lab, we’re committed to putting the students in charge of their education. But doing so can take a lot of different shapes, and Praxis has led to a lot of questions for me in the last year - questions that have been going round in my head all year and that have drifted outwards in this post. What are our limits at the lab in how design the student experience? How free can we be? How constrained? I’ve taken to jokingly describing the Praxis program as a riff on the tagline of the old MTV show Real World - “seven strangers picked to live in a house.” Except, in our case, we have six strangers picked to work on a project together. Are we setting them up for drama worthy of reality TV or for transformative learning experiences?
What is Praxis working on right now?
We’re working on being better. More on that soon!

I am pleased to announce that the Scholars’ Lab and UVA Library have been awarded $6,000 by the UVA Parents’ Fund to increase capacity for augmented and virtual reality teaching and research on grounds. The grant will support a small cohort of students this calendar year as they work with us to create public, novice-friendly documentation on how we apply these technologies to learning and research. If time allows and given student interest, they will also co-teach a workshop series on augmented reality for the university and Charlottesville communities and develop cultural heritage 3D data for preservation in our institutional repository. The hope is that this work will increase our capacity to support interest in these technologies, make our own lessons available to a broad public, offer professionally legible work for the students working to develop the project with us, and establish these same students as a community of experts who can help pay their experiences forward to others. The project is lead by Scholars’ Lab staff Brandon Walsh, Arin Bennett, and Will Rourk.
We are very grateful to the Parents’ Fund for their generous support of the Lab and of the Library!

Calling all UVA grad students! There’s snow on the ground, but it’s never too early to start thinking about spring. Or about what you’ll be doing next year!
Consider spending some time with us. The call for applications for next year’s Praxis cohort is now open!  Applications are due February 28th, 2019.
The Praxis Program is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars’ Lab. This fellowship supports a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.
Our first two cohorts designed and built Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined Ivanhoe, a WordPress theme enabling collaborative criticism through roleplay. Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA’s campus, and a Public Domain Toolkit for documenting the affects of legal changes on our ability to teach and research with free culture.
Beginning as a 2011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library’s Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now generously supported by UVa Library and GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA’s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
The Praxis fellowship replaces recipients’ teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.
Eligibility
All University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.
Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.
Applicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program during the year the fellowship will be held.
N.b. - praxis students are not expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to Brandon Walsh, our Head of Graduate Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.
How to Apply
The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent. The letter should include:

the applicant’s research interests;
summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;
summary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow;
and your availability on the days we’ve identified for group interviews March 18th from 11:00 to 12:00 and March 19th from 9:00 to 11:30. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process as well as completed application materials should be directed to Brandon Walsh.
We hope that you’ll consider applying. Please circulate broadly to all of your friends, colleagues, and students.

We are now accepting applications for the 2019-2020 DH Fellows Cohort!
Applications are due Friday, November 30th.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester.  A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.
History
Since its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners can be found on our People page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements


Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.


The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.*


Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.


Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.


A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.


How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials, all of which should be emailed directly to Brandon Walsh:


a cover letter, addressed to the selection committee, containing:


a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;


a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;


and a description of UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;




a Graduate Fellowship Application Form;


a dissertation abstract;


2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation;


and your availability for interviews on December 5th from 10:30AM-12:00PM or 1:00-2:00PM. We’re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on the 5th or 6th of December.


Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well.

Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award.

We are thrilled to announce the 2018-2019 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program, the Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship, and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 11 fellows from 6 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences and the School of Architecture. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past fellows!
Praxis Program
We are delighted to welcome 6 diverse disciplinary team members to the 8th year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:


Catherine Addington (Spanish)


Zhiqiu Jiang (Urban and Environmental Planning, Constructed Environment)


Eleanore Neumann (Art and Architectural History)


Mathilda Shepherd (Spanish)


Chloe Wells (Art and Architectural History)


Chris Whitehead (History)


Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s new project in the fall!
Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship
This year we will welcome 3 students to our short-term fellowship dedicated to boosting nascent digital humanities research in a flexible, collaborative environment.


Alyssa Collins (English, Fall 2018)


Christian Howard (English, Fall 2018)


Sarah McEleney (Slavic Languages and Literature, Summer 2018)


Alyssa and Christian will collaborate on a scraping and archiving project working with twitter data as it pertains to the relationship between literature and social justice. Sarah will be working on a project using machine learning to examine social realism in Soviet-era literature. These students will work with our R&D team for a single semester to rapidly prototype their project ideas and position themselves for future work in digital humanities. Look for more from them this coming year!
Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities
Finally, we are looking forward to working with Kelli Shermeyer and Sean Tennant, our 2018-2019 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.


Kelli Shermeyer’s (English) dissertation is titled  “Less-than-Human” Tragedy?: Ecologies of Suffering in Contemporary Tragic Drama.


Sean Tennant’s (Art and Architectural History) dissertation is titled Domestic Spaces in the Roman West: Architectural Adaptation in Gaul, Britannia, and Germania.


These fellows will work with our team throughout the year on substantial research projects related to their dissertations.
We are looking forward to working with all these fantastic students in the coming year!

I want to share several developments from the grad programs side of the Lab this semester. It’s been a busy fall, and I’m pleased with all the work the team has put into our programs!
For one, the CFPs for two of our fellowship programs are now live. The Praxis Program, which will welcome its eighth cohort next year, will have a deadline of February 15th for applications from PhD students at UVA. This flagship program is in many ways the core of our graduate community, and we’re very excited that it continues to thrive. I am also very pleased to announce that the Digital Humanities Prototyping fellowships, piloted this past year with a cohort of four students, will continue next year with its own application deadline of February 15th. Open to PhD and MA students at UVA, these fellowships are meant to shore up our support of students in the intermediate years of their graduate work, to provide collaborative projects a space in our fellowship portfolio, and to give young scholars a chance to craft a spark that might catch further down the line with applications for further funding here or elsewhere. Please tell your students and colleagues! I always strongly encourage students to get in touch with me if they are planning to apply - that way they will be on our radar for other opportunities down the line regardless of how this particular application shakes out. Along with our newly restructured DH Fellows program, these three fellowship programs provide support and experience for more stages of the graduate student timeline than was previously possible.
In addition to the fellowship announcements, I also wanted to draw attention to a revamping of what was formerly known as the “graduate fellowships” page. Our programs have grown a lot since this page was last revised, and the new “graduate fellowships and opportunities” page now better represents the wealth of offerings in the Scholars’ Lab. This new, catch-all page offers a space where students can see all of our opportunities beyond our annual fellowship programs. We regularly employ graduate students as Makerspace Technologists to assist in 3D printing and experimental computing in our makerspace (and we just released a call with multiple openings for spring 2018!). Cultural Heritage Informatics Interns each semester work with Will and Arin to 3D scan, process, and print artifacts all while getting course credit. Chris and Drew regularly work with student GIS Technicians who assist in the uploading of GIS datasets and creating applications on our GIS portal, all while getting valuable experience in spatial humanities. And, finally, a Mellon-funded collaboration with Washington and Lee University allows us to send students to their campus to give workshops on digital humanities to undergraduate courses. The amount of experience required for all these opportunities is quite variable, so be sure to read closely - in many cases we are more than happy to have you learn on the job. We’ve been doing all these things for quite a while, but hopefully now students can find easier access to information about our programs and how to get involved.
Finally, I’m especially pleased to share that we have a new section in this page on professional development for graduate students. The Scholars’ Lab programs give students valuable experiences and training, but we’ve also historically gone further than these official offerings. As UVA students apply to alt-ac and DH careers, we regularly give advice on the whole process, from finding a job to producing materials to interviewing. These offerings have long been ad hoc and by request, but I worried over the last several months that some potential students might get left out of such arrangements. A student might not know, for example, that we’d be willing to mock interview them in the happy event that they’re invited to campus for that digital humanities developer position. Or a student putting together their first job talk for a post-doc in digital humanities might not realize that we’re happy to lend a friendly ear and also share our own job talks.
This section is not perfect, and it by no means represents the sum of what any program can do to support graduate students. If you see something missing, drop me a line to let me know. But hopefully the statement of services there will serve as nice counterpoint to the values that we lay out in our group charter; hopefully the page’s presence will help someone find their way to us who might not otherwise have done so. After all, tacit assumptions about how others perceive our services can lead to people falling through the cracks, feeling like they’re going through a job search alone. Best that we be explicit, and best that we match our values with public statements of what we will do to back them up.
So in short - we’re here for you. If you’re part of the UVA community and looking for help with your DH or alt-ac job search, swing on by and let me know how we can help!

We are now accepting applications for the 2018-2019 DH Fellows Cohort!
Applications are due Wednesday, November 1st.
The Digital Humanities Fellowship supports advanced doctoral students doing innovative work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development.
Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.
Supported by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund, and a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
The award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester.  A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow’s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with Brandon Walsh.
See past fellowship winners on our People page. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.
Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements


Applicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.


The fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.*


Applicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program, but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.


Applicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.


A faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.


How to Apply
A complete application package will include the following materials, all of which should be emailed directly to Brandon Walsh:


a cover letter, addressed to the selection committee, containing:


a summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;


a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;


and a description of UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;




a Graduate Fellowship Application Form;


a dissertation abstract;


and 2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant’s dissertation director who can attest to the project’s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation.


Questions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well.

Please note that, per University policy, a student who has undertaken affiliate status and ceased to enroll full time is not eligible to resume full-time enrollment or hold a graduate teaching assistantship.  Because GTA appointments are a component of the DH Fellowship, students who have already undertaken affiliate status are not eligible to be considered for this award.

For the third year in a row, the Scholars’ Lab and the University of Virginia Library are helping host summer fellows from the Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative (LAMI) at UVA. The students will pursue original research this summer at UVA in consultation with a faculty mentor. For our part, the Scholars’ Lab and the Library have worked with Keisha John, Director of Diversity of Programs in the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, to organize a weekly series of workshops introducing the students to digital humanities and library research methods. They’ll be getting a broad introduction to digital research and the resources of the library as they think towards graduate school, and we’ve also coordinated weekly board game sessions over lunch (for SLab-style bonding).
In addition to introducing these students to the resources available at UVA and in the library system, the program aims to increase the number of demographically underrepresented students pursuing graduate work and careers in the academy. You can find more information about the program in a 2015 press release put out by UVA Today when our first cohort was in residence. Two of our own graduate fellows, Jordan Buysse and Sarah McEleney, are serving as dh mentors.
These are the students that you might meet if you happen to be around the Scholars’ Lab this summer. Look for more information about them and their projects by clicking through to their bios!

For the past several years, I’ve taught a Humanities Programming course at HILT. The course was piloted by Wayne Graham and Jeremy Boggs, but, these days, I co-teach the course with Ethan Reed, one of our DH fellows in the Scholars’ Lab. The course is a soup-to-nuts introduction to the kinds of methods and technologies that are useful for humanities programming. We’re changing the course a fair amount this year, so I thought I’d offer a few notes on what we’re doing and the pedagogical motivations for doing so. You can find our syllabus, slides, resources, and more on the site.
We broke the course down into two halves:


Basics: command line, Git, GitHub, HTML/CSS

Project: personal website



Programming concepts: Ruby

Project: Rails application deployed through Heroku and up on GitHub



In the first half, people learned the basic stack necessary to work towards a personal website, then deploying that site through GitHub pages. In the second half, students took in a series of lessons about Ruby syntax, but the underlying goal was to teach them the programming concepts common to a number of programming languages. Then, we shifted gears and had them work through a series of Rails tutorials that pushed them towards a real-life situation where they’re working through and on a thing (in this case a sort of platform for crowdsourcing transcriptions of images).
I really enjoyed teaching the Rails course, and I think there was a lot of good in it. But over the past few years it has raised a number of pedagogical questions for me:


What can you reasonably hope to teach in a week-long workshop?


Is it better to do more with less or less with more?


What is the upper-limit on the amount of new information students can take in during the week?


What will students actually use/remember from the course once the week is over?


To be fair, week-long workshops like this one often raise similar concerns for me. I had two main concerns about our course in particular.
The first was a question of audience. We got people of all different skill levels in the course. Some people were there to get going with programming for the first time. These newcomers often seemed really comfortable with the course during the first half, while the second half of the course could result in a lot of frustration when the difficulty of the material suddenly seemed to skyrocket. Other students were experienced developers with several languages under their belt who were there specifically to learn Rails. The first half of the course seemed to be largely review for this experienced group, while the second half was really what they were there to take on.  It’s great that we were able to pull in students with such diverse experiences, but I was especially concerned for the people new to programming who felt lost during the second half of the course. Those experienced folks looking to learn Rails? I think they can probably find their way into the framework some other way. But I didn’t want our course to turn people off from programming because the presentation of the material felt frustrating. We can fix that. I always feel as though we should be able to explain these methods to anyone, and I wanted our alumni to feel that they were empowered by their new experiences, not frustrated. I wanted our course to reflect that principle by focusing on this audience of people looking for an introduction, not an advanced tutorial.
I also wondered a lot about the outcomes of the course. I wondered how many of the students really did anything with web applications after the course was over. Those advanced students there specifically for Rails probably did, and I’m glad that they had tangible skills to walk away with. But, for the average person just getting into digital humanities programming, I imagine that Rails wasn’t something they were going to use right away. After all, you use what you need to do what you need. And, while Rails gives you a lot of options, it’s not necessarily the tool you need for the thing in front of you - specially when you’re starting out.
So we set about redesigning the course with some of these thoughts in mind and with a few principles:


Less is more.


A single audience is better than many.


If you won’t use it, you’ll lose it.


I wondered how we might redesign the course to better reflect the kinds of work that are most common to humanists using programming for their work. I sat down and thought about common tasks that I use programming for beyond building apps/web services. I made a list of some common tasks that, when they confront me, I go, “I can write a script for that!” The resulting syllabus is on the site, but I’ll reiterate it here. The main changes took place in the second half of the course:


Basics: command line, git, GitHub, HTML/CSS

Project: personal website



Programming concepts: Python

Project(s): Applied Python for acquiring, processing, and analyzing humanities data



The switch from Python to Ruby reflects, in part, my own changing practices, but I also find that the Pythonic syntax enforces good stylistic practices in learners. In place of working on a large Rails app, we keep the second half of the course focused on daily tasks that programming is good for. After learning the basic concepts from Python, we introduce a few case studies for applied Python. Like all our materials, these are available on our site. But I’d encourage interested folks to check out the Jupyter notebooks for these units if you’re interested. These are the new units on applications of Python to typical situations:


Working with CSV files


Getting data from API’s


Introduction to Web Scraping


Basic Text Analysis


In the process of working through these materials, the students work with real, live humanities data drawn from Project Gutenberg, the DPLA, and the Jack the Ripper Casebook. We walk the students through a few different options for building a corpus of data and working with it. After gathering data, we talk about problems with it and how to use it. Of course, you could run an entire course on such things. Our goal here is not to cover everything. In fact, I erred on the side of keeping the lessons relatively lightweight, with the assumption that the jump in difficulty level would require us to move pretty slowly. The main goal is to show how situations that appear to be much more complicated still boil down to the same basic concepts the students have just learned. We want to shrink the perceived gap between those beginning exercises and the kinds of scripts that are actually useful for your own day-to-day work. We introduce some slightly more advanced concepts along the way, but hopefully enough of the material will remain familiar that the students can excel. Ideally, the concepts we work through in these case studies will be more immediately useful to someone trying to introduce programming into their workflow for the first time. And, in being more immediately useful, the exercises might be more likely to give a lasting foundation for them to keep building on into the future.
We’ve also rebranded the course slightly. The course description has changed, as we’ve attempted to soften jargon and make it clear that students are meant to come to the course not knowing the terms or technologies in the description (they’re going to learn them with us!). The course name has changed as well, first as a joke but then in a serious way. Instead of simply being called “Humanities Programming,” the course is now “Help! I’m a Humanist! - code for Humanists with Python.” The goal there is to expose the human aspect of the course - no one is born knowing this stuff, and learning it means dealing with a load of tough feelings: anxiety, frustration, imposter syndrome, etc. I wanted to foreground all of this right away by making my own internal monologue part of the course title. The course can’t alleviate all those feelings, but I hoped to make it clear that we’re taking them into account and thinking about the human side of what it means to teach and learn this material. We’re in it together.
So. What can you do in a week? Quite a lot. What should you do - that’s a much tougher question. I’ve timed this post to go out right around when HILT starts. If I figure it out in the next week I’ll let you know.

I’ve accepted a new position as the Head of Graduate Programs in the Scholars’ Lab, and I’ll be transitioning into that role over the next few weeks! As a part of the interview process, we had to give a job talk. While putting together this presentation, I was lucky enough to have past examples to work from (as you’ll be able to tell, if you check out this past job talk by Amanda Visconti). Since my new position will involve helping graduate students through the process of applying for positions like these, it only feels right that I should post my own job talk as well as a few words on the thinking that went into it. Blemishes, jokes, and all, hopefully these materials will help someone in the future find a way in, just as the example of others did for me. And if you’re looking for more, Visconti has a great list of other examples linked from her more recent job talk for the Scholars’ Lab.
For the presentation, I was asked to respond to this prompt:

What does a student (from undergraduate to doctoral levels) need to learn or experience in order to add “DH” to his or her skill set? Is that an end or a means of graduate education? Can short-term digital assignments in discipline-specific courses go beyond “teaching with technology”? Why not refer everyone to online tutorials? Are there risks for doctoral students or the untenured in undertaking digital projects? Drawing on your own experience, and offering examples or demonstrations of digital research projects, pedagogical approaches, or initiatives or organizations that you admire, make a case for a vision of collaborative education in advanced digital scholarship in the arts and humanities.

I felt that each question could be a presentation all its own, and I had strong opinions about each one. Dealing with all of them seemed like a tall order. I decided to spend the presentation close reading and deconstructing that first sentence, taking apart the idea that education and/or digital humanities could be thought of in terms of lists of skills at all. Along the way, my plan was to dip into the other questions as able, but I also assumed that I would have plenty of time during the interview day to give my thoughts on them. I also wanted to try to give as honest a sense as possible of the way I approach teaching and mentoring. For me, it’s all about people and giving them the care that they need. In conveying that, I hoped, I would give the sort of vision the prompt was asking for. I also tried to sprinkle references to the past and present of the Scholars’ Lab programs to ground the content of the talk. When I mention potential career options in the body of the talk, I am talking about specific alumni who came through the fellowship programs. And when I mention graduate fellows potentially publishing on their work with the Twitter API, well, that’s not hypothetical either.
So below find the lightly edited text of the talk I gave at the Scholars’ Lab - “In, Out, Across, With: Collaborative Education and Digital Humanities.” I’ve only substantively modified one piece - swapping out one example for another.
And a final note on delivery: I have heard plenty of people argue over whether it is better to read a written talk or deliver one from notes. My own sense is that the latter is far more common for digital humanities talks. I have seen both fantastic read talks and amazing extemporaneous performances, just as I have seen terrible versions of each. My own approach is, increasingly, to write a talk but deliver that talk more or less from memory. In this case, I had a pretty long commute to work, so I recorded myself reading the talk and listened to it a lot to get the ideas in my head. When I gave the presentation, I had the written version in front of me for reference, but I was mostly moving through my own sense of how it all fit together in real time (and trying to avoid looking at the paper). My hope is that this gave me the best of both worlds and resulted in a structured but engaging performance. Your mileage may vary!
In, Out, Across, With: Collaborative Education and Digital Humanities
 
It’s always a treat to be able to talk with the members of the UVA Library community, and I am very grateful to be here. For those of you that don’t know me, I am Brandon Walsh, Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor of English at Washington and Lee University. The last time I was here, I gave a talk that had almost exclusively animal memes for slides. I can’t promise the same robust Internet culture in this talk, but talk to me after and I can hook you up. I swear I’ve still got it.
 
In the spirit of Amanda Visconti, the resources that went into this talk (and a number of foundational materials on the subject) can all be found in a Zotero collection at the above link. I’ll name check any that are especially relevant, but hopefully this set of materials will allow the thoughts in the talk to flower outwards for any who are interested in seeing its origins and echoes in the work of others.
 
And a final prefatory note: no person works, thinks or learns alone, so here are the names of the people in my talk whose thinking I touch upon as well as just some – but not all – of my colleagues at W&L who collaborate on the projects I mention. Top tier consists of people I cite or mention, second tier is for institutions or publications important to discussion, and final tier is for direct collaborators on this work.
Today I want to talk to you about how best to champion the people involved in collaborative education in digital research. I especially want to talk about students. And when I mention “students” throughout this talk, I will mostly be speaking in the context of graduate students. But most of what I discuss will be broadly applicable to all newcomers to digital research. My talk is an exhortation to find ways to elevate the voices of people in positions like these to be contributors to professional and institutional conversations from day one and to empower them to define the methods and the outcomes of the digital humanities that we teach. This means taking seriously the messy, fraught, and emotional process of guiding students through digital humanities methods, research, and careers. It means advocating for the legibility of this digital work as a key component of their professional development. And it means enmeshing these voices in the broader network around them, the local context that they draw upon for support and that they can enrich in turn. I believe it is the mission of the Head of Graduate Programs to build up this community and facilitate these networks, to incorporate those who might feel like outsiders to the work that we do. Doing so enriches and enlivens our communities and builds a better and more diverse research and teaching agenda.

This talk is titled “In, Out, Across, With: Collaborative Education and Digital Humanities,” and I’ll really be focusing on the prepositions of my title as a metaphor for the nature of this sort of position. I see this role as one of connection and relation. The talk runs about 24 minutes, so we should have plenty of time to talk.
When discussing digital humanities education, it is tempting to first and foremost discuss what, exactly, it is that you will be teaching. What should the students walk away knowing? To some extent, just as there is more than one way to make breakfast, you could devise numerous baseline curricula. 

This is what we came up with at Washington and Lee for students in our undergraduate digital humanities fellowship program. We tried to hit a number of kinds of skills that a practicing digital humanist might need. It’s by no means exhaustive, but the list is a way to start. We don’t expect one person to come away knowing everything, so instead we aim for students to have an introduction to a wide variety of technologies by the end of a semester or year. They’ll encounter some technologies applicable to project management, some to front-end design, as well as a variety of programming concepts broadly applicable to a variety of situations. Lists like this give some targets to hit. But still, even as someone who helped put this list together, it makes me worry a bit. I can imagine younger me being afraid of it! It’s easy for us to forget what it was like to be new, to be a beginner, to be learning for the first time, but I’d like to return us to that frame of thinking. I think we should approach lists like these with care, because they can be intimidating for the newcomer. So in my talk today I want to argue against lists of skills as ways of thinking.
I don’t mean to suggest that programs need no curriculum, nor do I mean to suggest that no skills are necessary to be a digital humanist. But I would caution against focusing too much on the skills that one should have at the end of a program, particularly when talking about people who haven’t yet begun to learn. I would wager that many people on the outside looking in think of DH in the same way: it’s a big list of unknowns. I’d like to get away from that.
Templates like this are important for developing courses, fellowship, and degree-granting programs, but I worry that the goodwill in them might all too easily seem like a form of gatekeeping to a new student. It is easy to imagine telling a student that “you have to learn GitHub before you can work on this project.” It’s just a short jump from this to a likely student response - “ah sorry - I don’t know that yet.” And from there I can all too easily imagine the common refrain that you hear from students of all levels - “If I can’t get that, then it’s because I’m not a technology person.” From there - “Digital humanities must not be for me.”
Instead of building our curricula out of as-yet-unknown tool chains, I want to float, today, a vision of DH education as an introduction to a series of professional practices. Lists of skills might be ends but I fear they might foreclose beginnings.

Instead, I will float something more in line with that of the Scholarly Communication Institute (held here at UVA for a time), which outlined what they saw as the needs of graduate and professional students in the digital age. I’ll particularly draw upon their first point here (last of my slides with tons of text, I swear): graduate students need training in “collaborative modes of knowledge production and sharing.”
I want to think about teaching DH as introducing a process of discovery that collapses hierarchies between expert and newcomer: that’s a way to start. This sort of framing offers digital humanities not as a series of methods one does or does not know, but, rather, as a process that a group can engage in together. Do they learn methods and skills in the process? Of course! Anyone who has taken part in the sort of collaborative group projects undertaken by the Scholars’ Lab comes away knowing more than they came in with. But I want to continue thinking about process and, in particular, how that process can be more inclusive and more engaging. By empowering students to choose what they want to learn and how they want to learn it, we can help to expand the reach of our work and better serve our students as mentors and collaborators. There are a few different in ways in which I see this as taking place, and they’ll form the roadmap for the rest of the talk. 
 
Apologies - this looks like the sort of slide you would get at a business retreat. All the same - we need to adapt and develop new professional opportunities for our students at the same time that we plan flexible outcomes for our educational programs. These approaches are meant to serve increasingly diverse professional needs in a changing job market, and they need to be matched by deepening support at the institutional level.
So to begin. One of our jobs as mentors is to encourage students to seek out professionally legible opportunities early on in their careers, and as shapers of educational programs we can go further and create new possibilities for them. At W&L, we have been collaborating with the Scholars’ Lab to bring UVA graduate students to teach short-form workshops on digital research in W&L classrooms. Funded opportunities like this one can help students professionalize in new ways and in new contexts while paying it forward to the nearby community. A similar initiative at W&L that I’ve been working on has our own library faculty and undergraduate fellows visiting local high schools to speak with advanced AP computer science students about how their own programming work can apply to humanities disciplines. I’m happy to talk more about these in Q&A.

We also have our student collaborators present at conferences, both on their own work and on work they have done with faculty members, both independently and as co-presenters. Here is Abdur, one of our undergraduate Mellon DH fellows, talking about the writing he does for his thesis and how it is enriched by and different from the writing he does in digital humanities contexts at the Bucknell Digital Scholarship Conference last fall. While this sort of thing is standard for graduate students, it’s pretty powerful for an undergraduate to present on research in this way. Learning that it’s OK to fail in public can be deeply empowering, and opportunities like these encourage our students to think about themselves as valuable contributors to ongoing conversations long before they might otherwise feel comfortable doing so.
But teaching opportunities and conferences are not the only ways to get student voices out there. I think there are ways of engaging student voices earlier, at home, in ways that can fit more situations. We can encourage students to engage in professional conversations by developing flexible outcomes in which we are equal participants. One approach to this with which I have been experimenting is group writing, which I think is undervalued as a taught skill and possible approach to DH pedagogy. An example: when a history faculty member at W&L approached the library (and by extension, me) for support in supplementing an extant history course with a component about digital text analysis, we could have agreed to offer a series of one-off workshops and be done with it.

Instead, this faculty member – Professor Sarah Horowitz – and I decided to collaborate on a more extensive project together, producing Introduction to Text Analysis: A Coursebook. The idea was to put the materials for the workshops together ahead of time, in collaboration, and to narrativize them into a set of lessons that would persist beyond a single semester as a kind of publication. The pedagogical labor that we put into reshaping her course could become, in some sense, professionally legible as a series of course modules that others could use beyond the term. So for the book, we co-authored a series of units on text analysis and gave feedback on each other’s work, editing and reviewing as well as reconfiguring them for the context of the course. Professor Horowitz provided more of the discipline-specific material that I could not, and I provided the materials more specific to the theories and methods of text analysis. Neither one of us could have written the book without the other.
Professor Horowitz was, in effect, a student in this moment. She was also a teacher and researcher. She was learning at the same time that she produced original scholarly contributions. Even as we worked together, for me this collaborative writing project was also a pedagogical experiment that drew upon the examples of Robin DeRosa, Shawn Graham, and Cathy Davidson, in particular. 
 
Davidson taught a graduate course on “21st Century Literacies” where each of her students wrote a chapter that was then collected and published as an open-access book. For us as for Davidson, the process of knowing, the process of uncovering is something that happens together. In public. And it’s documented so that others can benefit. Our teaching labor could become visible and professionally legible, as could the labor that Professor Horowitz put into learning new research skills. As she adapts and tries out ideas, and as we coalesce them into a whole, the writing product is both the means and the end of an introduction to digital humanities.
Professor Horowitz also wanted to learn technical skills herself, and she learned quite a lot through the writing process. Rather than sitting through lectures or being directed to online tutorials by me, I thought she would learn better by engaging with and shaping the material directly. Her course and my materials would be better for it, as she would be helping to bind my lectures and workshops to her course material. The process would also require her to engage with a list of technologies for digital publishing.
 
Beyond the text analysis materials and concepts, the process exposed her to a lot of technologies: command line, Markdown, Git for version control, GitHub for project management. In the process of writing this document, in fact, she covered most of the same curriculum as our undergraduate DH fellows.
 
She’s learning these things as we work together to produce course materials, but, importantly, the technical skills aren’t the focus of the work together. It’s a writing project! Rather than presenting the skills as ends in themselves, they were the means by which we were publishing a thing. They were immediately useful. And I think displacing the technology is helpful: it means that the outcomes and parameters for success are not based in the technology itself but, rather, in the thinking about and use of those methods. We also used a particular platform that allowed Professor Horowitz to engage with these technologies in a light way so that they would not overwhelm our work – I’m happy to discuss more in the time after if you’re interested.
This to say: the outcomes of such collaborative educations can be shaped to a variety of different settings and types of students. Take another model, CUNY’s Graduate Center Digital Fellows program, whose students develop open tutorials on digital tools. Learning from this example, rather than simply direct students or colleagues towards online tutorials like these, why not have them write their own documents, legible for their own positions, that synthesize and remix the materials that they already have found?
 
The learning process becomes something productive in this framing. I can imagine, for example, directing collaboratively authored materials by students like these towards something like The Programming Historian. If you’re not familiar, The Programming Historian offers a variety of lessons on digital humanities methods, and they only require an outline as a pitch to their editorial team, not a whole written publication ready to go. Your graduate students could, say, work with the Twitter API over the course of a semester, blog about the research outcomes, and then pitch a tutorial to The Programming Historian on the API as a result of their work. It’s much easier to motivate yourselves to write something if you know that the publication has already been accepted. Obviously such acceptance is not a given, but working towards a goal like this can offer student researchers something to aim for. Their instructors could co-author these materials, even, so that everyone has skin in the game.
This model changes the shape of what collaborative education can look like: it’s duration and its results. You don’t need a whole fellowship year. You could, in a reasonably short amount of time, tinker and play, and produce a substantial blog post, an article pitch, or a Library Research Guide (more on that in a moment).

As Jeff Jarvis has said, “we need to move students up the education chain.” And trust me - the irony of quoting a piece titled “Lectures are Bullshit” during a lecture to you is not lost on me. But stay with me.
Collaborative writing projects on DH topics are flexible enough to fit the many contexts for the kind of educational work that we do. After all, no one needs or values the same outcomes, and these shared and individual goals need to be worked out in conversation with the students themselves early on. Articulating these desires in a frank, written, and collaborative mode early on (in the genre of the project charter), can help the program directors to better shape the work to fit the needs of the students. But I also want to suggest that collaborative writing projects can be useful end products as well as launching pads, as they can fit the shape of many careers. After all, students come to digital humanities for a variety of different reasons. Some might be aiming to bolster a research portfolio on the path to a traditional academic career. Others might be deeply concerned about the likelihood of attaining such a position and be looking for other career options. Others still might instead be colleagues interested in expanding their research portfolio or skillset but unable to commit to a whole year of work on top of their current obligations. Writing projects could speak to all these situations.
I see someone in charge of shaping graduate programs as needing to speak to these diverse needs. This person is both a steward of where students currently are – the goals and objectives they might currently have – as well as of where they might go – the potential lives they might (or might not!) lead. After all, graduate school, like undergraduate, is an enormously stressful time of personal and professional exploration. If we think simply about a student’s professional development as a process of finding a job, we overlook the real spaces in which help might be most desired. Frequently, those needs are the anxieties, stresses, and pressures of refashioning yourself as a professional. We should not be in the business of creating CV lines or providing lists of qualifications alone. We should focus on creating strong, well-adjusted professionals by developing ethical programs that guide them into the professional world by caring for them as people.
In the graduate context, this involves helping students deal with the academic job market in particular.
 
To me in its best form, this means helping students to look at their academic futures and see proliferating possibilities instead of a narrow and uncertain route to a single job, to paraphrase the work of Katina Rogers. A sprinkler rather than a pipeline, in her metaphor. As Rogers’s work, in particular, has shown, recent graduate students increasingly feel that, while they experienced strong expectations that they would continue in the professoriate, they received inadequate preparation for the many different careers they might actually go on to have. The Praxis Program and the Praxis Network are good examples of how to position digital humanities education as answers to these issues. Fellowship opportunities like these must be robust enough that they can offer experiences and outcomes beyond the purely technical, so that a project manager from one fellowship year can graduate with an MA and go into industry in a similar role just as well-prepared as a PhD student aiming to be a developer might go on to something entirely different. And the people working these programs must be prepared for the messy labor of helping students to realize that these are satisfactory, laudable professional goals.
It should be clear that this sort of personal and professional support is the work of more than just one person. One of the strengths of a digital humanities center embedded in a library like this one at UVA is that fellows have the readymade potential to brush up against a variety of career options that become revealed when peaking outside of their disciplinary silos: digital humanities developers and project manager positions, sure, but also metadata specialists, archivists, and more. I think this kind of cross-pollination should be encouraged: library faculty and staff have a lot to offer student fellows and vice versa. Developing these relationships brings the fellows further into the kinds of the work done in the library and introduces them to careers that, while they might require further study to obtain, could be real options.
To my mind the best fellowship programs are those fully aware of their institutional context and those that both leverage and augment the resources around them as they are able. We have been working hard on this at W&L. We are starting to institute a series of workshops led by the undergraduate fellows in consultation with the administrators of the fellowship program. The idea is that past fellows lead workshops for later cohorts on the technology they have learned, some of which we selectively open to the broader library faculty and staff. The process helps to solidify the student’s training – no better way to learn than to teach – but it also helps to expand the student community by retaining fellows as committed members. It also helps to fill out a student’s portfolio with a cv-ready line of teaching experience. This process also aims to build our own capacity within the library by distributing skills among a wider array of students, faculty, and staff. After all, student fellows and librarians have much they could learn from one another. I see the Head of Graduate Programs as facilitating such collaborations, as connecting the interested student with the engaged faculty/staff/librarian collaborator, inside their institution or beyond.
But we must not forget that we are asking students and junior faculty to do risky things by developing these new interests, by spending time and energy on digital projects, let alone presenting and writing on them in professional contexts. The biggest risk is that we ask them to do so without supporting them adequately. All the technical training in the world means little if that work is illegible and irrelevant to your colleagues or committee.
 
In the words of Kathleen Fitzpatrick, we ask these students to “do the risky thing,” but we must “make sure that someone’s got their back.” I see the Head of Graduate Programs as the key in coordinating, fostering, and providing such care.
Students and junior faculty need support – for technical implementation, sure – but they also need advocates – people who can vouch for the quality of their work and campaign on their behalf in the face of committees and faculty who might be otherwise unable to see the value of their work. Some of this can come from the library, from people able to put this work in the context of guidelines for the evaluation of digital scholarship. But some of this support and advocacy has to come from within their home departments. The question is really how to build up that support from the outside in. And that’s a long, slow process that occurs by making meaningful connections and through outreach programs. At W&L, we have worked to develop an incentive grant program, where we incentivize faculty members who might be new to digital humanities or otherwise skeptical to experiment with incorporating a digital project into their course. The result is a slow burn – we get maybe one or two new faculty each term trying something out. That might seem small, but it’s something, particularly at a small liberal arts college. This kind of slow evangelizing is key in helping the work done by digital humanists to be legible to everyone. Students and junior faculty need advocates for their work in and out of the library and their home departments, and the person in this position is tasked with overseeing such outreach.
So, to return to the opening motif, lists of skillsets certainly have their place as we bring new people into the ever-expanding field: they’re necessary. They reflect a philosophy and a vision, and they’re the basis of growing real initiatives. But it’s the job of the Head of Graduate Programs to make sure that we never lose sight of the people and relationships behind them.
Foremost, then, I see the Head of Graduate Programs as someone who takes the lists, documents, and curricula that I have discussed and connects them to the people that serve them and that they are meant to speak to. This person is one who builds relationships, who navigates the prepositions of my title.
 
It’s the job of such a person to blast the boundary between “you’re in” and “you’re out” so that the tech-adverse or shy student can find a seat at the table. This is someone who makes sure that the work of the fellows is represented across institutions and in their own departments. This person makes sure the fellows are well positioned professionally. This person builds up people and embeds them to networks where they can flourish. Their job is never to forget what it’s like to be the person trying to learn. Their job is to hear “I’m not a tech person” and answer “not yet, but you could be! and I know just the people to help. Let’s learn together.”

What follows is a slightly more fleshed out version of what I presented this past week at HASTAC 2016 (complete with my memory-inflected transcript of the Q&A). I gave a bit more context for the project at the event than I do here, so it might be helpful to read my past two posts on the project here and here before going forward. This talk continues that conversation.]
This year in the Scholar’s Lab I have been working with Eric on a machine learning project that studies speech in Virginia Woolf’s fiction. I have written elsewhere about the background for the project and initial thoughts towards its implications. For the purposes of this blog post, I will just present a single example to provide context. Consider the famous first line of Mrs. Dalloway:

Mrs Dalloway said, “I will buy the flowers myself.”

Nothing to remark on here, except for the fact that this is not how the sentence actually comes down to us. I have modified it from the original:

Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.

My project concerns moments like these, where Woolf implies the presence of speech without marking it as such with punctuation. I have been working with Eric to lift such moments to the surface using computational methods so that I can study them more closely.
I came to the project by first tagging such moments myself as I read through the text, but I quickly found myself approaching upwards of a hundred instances in a single novel-far too many for me to keep track of in any systematic way. What’s more, the practice made me aware of just how subjective my interpretation could be. Some moments, like this one, parse fairly well as speech. Others complicate distinctions between speech, narrative, and thought and are more difficult to identify. I became interested in the features of such moments. What is it about speech in a text that helps us to recognize it as such, if not for the quotation marks themselves? What could we learn about sound in a text from the ways in which it structures such sound moments?
These interests led me towards a particular kind of machine learning, supervised classification, as an alternate means of discovering similar moments. For those unfamiliar with the concept, an analogy might be helpful. As I am writing this post on a flight to HASTAC and just finished watching a romantic comedy, these are the tools that I will work with. Think about the genre of the romantic comedy. I only know what this genre is by virtue of having seen my fair share of them over the course of my life. Over time I picked up a sense of the features associated with these films: a serendipitous meeting leads to infatuation, things often seem resolved before they really are, and the films often focus on romantic entanglements more than any other details. You might have other features in mind, and not all romantic comedies will conform to this list. That’s fine: no one’s assumptions about genre hold all of the time. But we can reasonably say that, the more romantic comedies I watch, the better my sense of what a romantic comedy is. My chances of being able to watch a movie and successfully identify it as conforming to this genre will improve with further viewing. Over time, I might also be able to develop a sense of how little or how much a film departs from these conventions.
Supervised classification works on a similar principle. By using the proper tools, we can feed a computer program examples of something in order to have it later identify similar objects. For this project, this process means training the computer to recognize and read for speech by giving it examples to work from. By providing examples of speech occurring within quotation marks, we can teach the program when quotation marks are likely to occur. By giving it examples of what I am calling ‘implied speech,’ it can learn how to identify those as well.
For this machine learning project, I analyzed Woolf texts downloaded from Project Gutenberg. Eric and I put together scripts in Python 3 that used a package known as the Natural Language Toolkit] for classifying. All of this work can be found at the project’s GitHub repository.
The project is still ongoing, and we are still working out some difficulties in our Python scripts. But I find the complications of the process to be compelling in their own right. For one, when working in this way we have to tell the computer what features we want it to pay attention to: a computer does not intuitively know how to make sense of the examples that we want to train it on. In the example of romantic comedies, I might say something along the lines of “while watching these films, watch out for the scenes and dialogue that use the word ‘love.’” We break down the larger genre into concrete features that can be pulled out so that the program knows what to watch out for.
To return to Woolf, punctuation marks are an obvious feature of interest: the author suggests that we have shifted into the realm of speech by inserting these grammatical markings. Find a quotation mark-you are likely to be looking at speech. But I am interested in just those moments where we lose those marks, so it helps to develop a sense of how they might work. We can then begin to extrapolate those same features to places where the punctuation marks might be missing. We have developed two models for understanding speech in this way: an external and an internal model. To illustrate, I have taken a single sentence and bolded what the model takes to be meaningful features according to each model. Each represents a different way of thinking about how we recognize something as speech.
External Model for Speech:

“I love walking in London,” said Mrs. Dalloway.  ”Really it’s better than walking in the country.”

The external model was our initial attempt to model speech. In it, we take an interest in the narrative context around quotation marks. In any text, we can say that there exist a certain range of keywords that signal a shift into speech: said, recalled, exclaimed, shouted, whispered, etc. Words like these help the narrative attribute speech to a character and are good indicators that speech is taking place. Given a list of words like this, we could reasonably build a sense of the locations around which speech is likely to be happening. So when training the program on this model, we had the classifier first identify locations of quotation marks. Around each quotation mark, the program took note of the diction and parts of speech that occurred within a given distance from the marking. We build up a sense of the context around speech.
Internal Model for Speech:

“I love walking in London,” said Mrs. Dalloway. “Really it’s better than walking in the country.”

The second model we have been working with works in an inverse direction: instead of taking an interest in the surrounding context of speech, an internal model assumes that there are meaningful characteristics within the quotation itself. In this example, we might notice that the shift to the first-person ‘I’ is a notable feature in a text that is otherwise largely written in the third person. This word suggests a shift in register. Each time this model encounters a quotation mark it continues until it finds a second quotation mark. The model then records the diction and parts of speech inside the pair of markings.
Each model suggests a distinct but related understanding for how sound works in the text. When I set out on this project, I had aimed to use the scripts to give me quantifiable evidence for moments of implied speech in Woolf’s work. The final step in this process, after all, is to actually use these models to identify speech: looking at texts they haven’t seen before, the scripts insert a caret marker every time they believe that a quotation mark should occur. But it quickly became apparent that the construction of the algorithms to describe such moments would be at least as interesting as any results that the project could produce. In the course of constructing them, I have had to think about the relationships among sound, text, and narrative in new ways.
The algorithms are each interpretative in the sense that they reflect my own assumptions about my object of study. The models also reflect assumptions about the process of reading, how it takes place, and about how a reader converts graphic markers into representations of sound. In this sense, the process of preparing for and executing text analysis reflects a certain phenomenology of reading as much as it does a methodology of digital study. The scripting itself is an object of inquiry in its own right and reflects my own interpretation of what speech can be. These assumptions are worked and reworked as I craft algorithms and python scripts, all of which are as shot through with humanistic inquiry and interpretive assumptions as any close readings.
For me, such revelations are the real reasons for pursuing digital study: attempting to describe complex humanities concepts computationally helps me to rethink basic assumptions about them that I had taken for granted. In the end, the pursuit of an algorithm to describe textual speech is nothing more or less than the pursuit of deeper and enriched theories of text and speech themselves.
Postscript
I managed to take note of the questions I got when I presented this work at HASTAC, so what follows are paraphrases of my memory of them as well as some brief remarks that roughly reflect what I said in the moment. There may have been one other that I cannot quite recall, but alas such is the fallibility of the human condition.
Q: You distinguish between speech and implied speech, but do you account at all for the other types of speech in Woolf’s novels? What about speech that is remembered speech that happened in earlier timelines not reflected in the present tense of the narrative’s events?
A: I definitely encountered this during my first pass at tagging speech and implied speech in the text by hand. Instead of binaries like quoted speech/implied speech, I found myself wanting to mark for a range of speech types: present, actual; remembered, might not have happened; remembered incorrectly; remembered, implied; etc. I decided that a binary was more feasible for the machine learning problems that I was interested in, but the whole process just reinforced how subjective any reading process is: another reader might mark things differently. If these processes shape the construction of the theories that inform the project, then they necessarily also affect the algorithms themselves as well as the results they can produce. And it quickly becomes apparent that these decisions reflect a kind of phenomenology of reading as much as anything: they illlustrate my understanding of how a complicated set of markers and linguistic phenomenon contribute to our understanding that a passage is speech or not.
Q: Did you encounter any variations in the particular markings that Woolf was using to punctuate speech? Single quotes, etc., and how did you account for them?
A: Yes - the version of Orlando that I am working with used single quotes to notate speech. So I was forced to account for such edge cases. But the question points at two larger issues: one authorial and one bibliographical. As I worked on Woolf I was drawn to the idea of being able to run such a script against a wider corpus. Since the project seemed to impinging on how we also understand psychologized speech, it would be fascinating to be able to search for implied speech in other authors. But, if you are familiar with, say, Joyce, you might remember that he hated quotation marks and used dashes to denote speech. The question is how much can you account for such edge cases, and, if not, the study becomes only one of a single author’s idiosyncrasies (which still has value). But from there the question spirals outwards. At least one of my models (the internal one) relies on quotation marks themselves as boundary markers. The model assumes that quotation marks will come in pairs, and this is not always the case. Sometimes authors, intentionally or accidentally, omit a closing quotation mark. I had to massage the data in at least half a dozen places where there was no quotation mark in the text and where its lack was causing my program to fail entirely. As textual criticism has taught us, punctuation marks are the single most likely things to be modified over time during the process of textual transmission by scribes, typesetters, editors, and authors. So in that sense, I am not doing a study of Woolf’s punctuation so much as a study of Woolf’s punctuation in these particular versions of the texts. One can imagine an exhaustive study that works on all versions of all Woolf’s texts as a study that might approach some semblance of a correct and thorough reading. For this project, however, I elected to take the lesser of two evils that would still allow me to work through the material. I worked with the texts that I had. I take all of this as proof that you have to know your corpus and your own shortcomings in order to responsibly work on the materials - such knowledge helps you to validate your responses, question your results, and reframe your approaches.
Q: You talked a lot about text approaching sound, but what about the other way around - how do things like implied speech get reflected in audiobooks, for example? Is there anything in recordings of Woolf that imply a kind of punctuation that you can hear?
A: I wrote about this extensively in my dissertation, but for here I will just say that I think the textual phenomenon the questioner is referencing occurs on a continuum. Some graphic markings, like pictures, shapes, punctuation marks, do not clearly translate to sound. And the reverse is true: the sounded quality of a recording can only ever be remediated by a print text. There are no perfect analogues between different media forms. Audiobook performers might attempt to convey things like punctuation or implied speech (in the audiobook of Ulysses, for example, Jim Norton throws his voice and lowers his volume to suggest free indirect discourse). In the end, I think such moments are playing with an idea of what my dissertation calls audiotextuality, the idea that all texts recordings of texts, to varying degrees, contain both sound and print elements. The two spheres may work in harmony or against each other as a kind of productive friction. The idea is a slippery one, but I think it speaks to moments like the implied punctuation mark that come through in a particularly powerful audiobook recording.

This year I am working with Eric Rochester on a fellowship project that has me learning natural language processing (NLP), the application of computational methods to human languages. We’re adapting these techniques to study quotation marks in the novels of Virginia Woolf (read more about the project here). We actually started several months before this academic year began, and, as we close out another semester, I have been spending time thinking about just what has made it such an effective learning experience for me. I already had a technical background from my time in the Scholars’ Lab at the beginning of the process, but I had no experience with Python or NLP. Now I feel most comfortable with the former of any other programming language and familiar enough with the latter to experiment with it in my own work.
The general mode of proceeding has been this: depending on schedules and deadlines, we meet once or twice every two weeks. Between our meetings I would work as far and as much as I could, and the sessions would offer a space for Eric and me to talk about what I had done. The following are a handful of things we have done that, I think, have helped to create such an effective environment for learning new technical skills. Though they are particular to this study, I think they can be usefully extrapolated to apply to many other project-based courses of study in digital humanities. They are primarily written from the perspective of a student but with an eye to how and why the methods Eric used proved so effective for me.
Let the Wheel Be Reinvented Before Sharing Shortcuts
I came to Eric with a very small program adapted from Matt Jockers’s book on_ Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature_ that did little beyond count quotation marks and give some basic statistics. I was learning as I built the thing, so I was unaware that I was reinventing the wheel in many cases, rebuilding many protocols for dealing with commonly recognized problems that come from working with natural language. After working on my program and my approach to a degree of satisfaction, Eric pulled back the curtain to reveal that a commonly used python module, the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK), could address many of my issues and more. NLTK came as something of a revelation, and working inductively in this way gave me a great sense of the underlying problems the tools could address. By inventing my own way to read in a text, clean it to make its text uniformly readable by the computer, and breaking the whole piece into a series of words that could be analyzed, I understood the magic behind a couple lines of NLTK code that could do all that for me. The experience also helped me to recognize ways in which we would have to adapt NLTK for our own purposes as I worked through the book.
Have a Plan, but Be Flexible
After discussing NLTK and how it offered an easier way of doing the things that I wanted, Eric had me systematically work through the NLTK book for a few months. Our meetings took on the character of an independent study: the book set the syllabus, and I went through the first seven chapters at my own pace. Working from a book gave our meetings structure, but we were careful not to hew too closely to the material. Not all chapters were relevant to the project, and we cut sections of the book accordingly. We shaped the course of study to the intellectual questions rather than the other way around.
Move from Theory to Practice / Textbook to Project
As I worked through the book, I was able to recognize certain sections that felt most relevant to the Woolf work. Once I felt as though I had reached a critical mass, we switched from the book to the project itself and started working. I tend to learn from doing best, so the shift from theory to execution was a natural one. The quick and satisfying transition helped the work to feel productive right away: I was applying my new skills as I was still learning to feel comfortable with them. Where the initial months had more the feel of a traditional student-teacher interaction, the project-based approach we took up at this point felt more like a real and true collaboration. Eric and I would develop to-do items together, we would work alongside each other, and we would talk over the project together.
Document Everything
Between our meetings I would work as far and as much as I could, carefully noting places at which I encountered problems. In some cases, these were conceptual problems that needed clarifying, and these larger questions frequently found their way into separate notes. But my questions were frequently about what a particular line of code, a particular command or function, might be doing. In that case, I made comments directly in the code describing my confusion. I quickly found that these notes were as much for me as for Eric–I needed to get back in the frame of mind that led to the confusion in the first place, and copious notes helped remind me what the problem was. These notes offered a point of departure for our meetings: we always had a place to start, and we did so based on the work that I had done.
Communicate in as Many Ways as Possible
We met in person as much as possible, but we also used a variety of other platforms to keep things moving. Eric and I had all of our code on GitHub so that we could share everything that we had each been working on and discuss things from a distance if necessary. Email, obviously, can do a lot, but I found the chat capabilities of the Scholars’ Lab’s IRC channel to be far better for this sort of work. If I hit a particular snag that would only require a couple minutes for Eric to answer, we could quickly work things out through a web chat. With Skype and Google Hangouts we could even share the code on the other person’s computer even from hundreds of miles away. All of these things meant that we could keep working around whatever life events happened to call us away.
Recognize Spinning Wheels
These multiple avenues of communication are especially important when teaching technical skills. Not all questions or problems are the same: students can work through some on their own, but others can take them days to troubleshoot. Some amount of frustration is a necessary part of learning, and I do think it’s necessary that students learn to confront technical problems on their own. But not all frustration is pedagogically productive. There comes a point when you have tried a dozen potential solutions and you feel as though you have hit a wall. An extra set of eyes can (and should) help. Eric and I talked constantly about how to recognize when it was time for me to ask for help, and low-impact channels of communication like IRC could allow him to give me quick fixes to what, to me at least, seemed like impossible problems. Software development is a collaborative process, and asking for help is an important skill for humanists to develop.
In-person Meetings Can Take Many Forms
When we met, Eric and I did a lot of different things. First, we would talk through my questions from the previous week. If I felt a particular section of code was clunky or poorly done, he would talk and walk me through rewriting the same piece in a more elegant form. We would often pair program, where Eric would write code while I watched, carefully stopping him each time I had a question about something he was doing. And we often took time to reflect on where the collaboration was going - what my end goal was as well as what my tasks before the next meeting would be. Any project has many pieces that could be dealt with at any time, and Eric was careful to give me solo tasks that he felt I could handle on my own, reserving more difficult tasks for times in which we would be able to work together. All of this is to say that any single hour we spent together was very different from the last. We constantly reinvented what the meetings looked like, which kept them fresh and pedagogically effective.
This is my best attempt to recreate my experience of working in such a close mentoring relationship with Eric. Obviously, the collaboration relies on an extremely low student-to-teacher ratio: I can imagine this same approach working very well for a handful of students, but this work required a lot of individual attention that would be hard to sustain for larger classes. One idea for scaling the process up might be to divide a course into groups, being training one, and then have students later in the process begin to mentor those who are just beginning. Doing so would preserve what I see as the main advantage of this approach: it helps to collapse the hierarchy between student and teacher and engage both in a common project. Learning takes place, but it does so in the context of common effort. I’d have to think more about how this mentorship model could be adapted to fit different scenarios. The work with Eric is ongoing, but it’s already been one of the most valuable learning experiences I have had.

For the last couple weeks, I have been exploring APIs useful to sound studies for a sound recording and poetry project I am working on with former Scholars’ Lab fellow Annie Swafford. I was especially drawn to playing around with Spotify, which has an API that allows you to access metadata for the large catalog of music available through their service. The experiment described below focuses on genre: a notoriously messy category that we nonetheless rely on to tell us how to process the materials we read, view, or hear. Genre tells us what to expect from the art we take in, and our construction and reception of generic categories can tell us a lot about ourselves. In music, especially, genres and subgenres can activate fierce debates about authenticity and belonging. Does your favorite group qualify as “authentic” jazz? What composers do you have to know in order to think of yourself as a real classical music aficionado? Playing with an artist’s metadata can expose a lot of the assumptions that were made in its collection, and I was especially interested in the ways in which Spotify models relations among artists.
I wanted to explore Spotify’s metadata in a way that would model the interpretive messiness of generic categories. To do so, I built a program that bounces through Spotify’s metadata to produce multiple readings of the idea of genre in relation to a particular artist. Spotify offers a fairly robust API, and there are a number of handy wrappers that make it easier to work with. I used a Python module called Spotipy for the material below, and you can find the code for my little genre experiment over on my GitHub page. If you do try to run this on your own machine, note that you will need to clone Spotipy’s repository and manually install it from the terminal with the following command from within the downloaded repository:
$ python setup.py install
Pip will install an older distribution of the code that will only run in Python 2, but Spotipy’s GitHub page has a more recent release that is compatible with Python 3.
When run, the program outputs what I like to think of as the equivalent of music nerds arguing over musical genres. You provide an artist name and a number, and the terminal will work through Spotify’s API to produce the specified number of individual “mappings” of that artist’s genre as well as an aggregate list of all their associated genres. The program starts by pulling out all the genre categories associated with the given artist as well as those given to artists that Spotify flags as related. Once finished, the program picks one of those related artists at random and continues to do the same until the process returns no new genre categories, building up a list of associated genres over time.
So, in short, you give the program an artist and it offers you a few attempts at describing that artist generically using Spotify’s catalog, the computational equivalent of instigating an argument about genre in your local record store. Here are the results for running the program three times for the band New Order:

Individual genre maps
Just one nerd's opinions on New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'new romantic', 'new wave pop', 'hi nrg', 'europop', 'power pop', 'album rock']
Just one nerd's opinions on New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'gothic metal', 'j-metal', 'visual kei', 'intelligent dance music', 'uk post-punk', 'metropopolis', 'ambient', 'big beat', 'electronic', 'illbient', 'piano rock', 'trance', 'progressive house', 'progressive trance', 'uplifting trance', 'quebecois', 'deep uplifting trance', 'garage rock', 'neo-psychedelic', 'space rock', 'japanese psychedelic']
Just one nerd's opinions on New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'uk post-punk', 'gothic rock', 'discofox', 'madchester', 'britpop', 'latin', 'latin pop', 'teen pop', 'classic colombian pop', 'rai', 'pop rap', 'southern hip hop', 'trap music', 'deep rai']
Aggregate genre map for New Order:
['dance rock', 'new wave', 'permanent wave', 'new romantic', 'new wave pop', 'hi nrg', 'europop', 'power pop', 'album rock', 'gothic metal', 'j-metal', 'visual kei', 'intelligent dance music', 'uk post-punk', 'metropopolis', 'ambient', 'big beat', 'electronic', 'illbient', 'piano rock', 'trance', 'progressive house', 'progressive trance', 'uplifting trance', 'quebecois', 'deep uplifting trance', 'garage rock', 'neo-psychedelic', 'space rock', 'japanese psychedelic', 'gothic rock', 'discofox', 'madchester', 'britpop', 'latin', 'latin pop', 'teen pop', 'classic colombian pop', 'rai', 'pop rap', 'southern hip hop', 'trap music', 'deep rai']

In each case, the genre maps all begin the same, with the categories directly assigned to the source artist. Because the process is slightly random, the program eventually maps the same artist’s genre differently each time. For each iteration, the program runs until twenty randomly selected related artists return no new genre categories, which I take to be a kind of threshold of completion for one understanding of an artist’s genre.
The results suggest an amalgam of generic influence, shared characteristics, common lineages, and overlapping angles of approach. The decisions I made in how the program interacts with Spotify’s metadata suggest a definition of genre like the one offered by Alastair Fowler: “Representatives of a genre may then be regarded as making up a family whose septs and individual members are related in various ways, without necessarily having any single feature shared in common by all” (41). Genre is fluid and a matter of interpretive opinion - it is not necessarily based on objective links. The program reflects this in its results: sometimes a particular generic mapping feels very coherent, while at other times the script finds its way to very bizarre tangents. The connections do exist in the metadata if you drill down deeply enough, and it is possible to reproduce the links that brought about such output. But the more leaps the program takes from the original artist the more tenuous the connections appear to be. As I wrote this sentence, the program suggested a connection between garage rock revivalists The Strokes and big band jazz music: such output looks less like a conversation among music nerds and more like the material for a Ph.D. dissertation. As the program illustrates, generic description is the beginning of interpretation - not the ending.
Of course, the program does not actually search all music ever: it only has access to the metadata for artists listed in Spotify, and some artists like Prince or the Beatles are notoriously missing from the catalog. Major figures like these have artist pages that serve as stubs for content drawn largely from compilation CDs, and the program can successfully crawl through these results. But this wrinkle points to a larger fact: the results the program produces are as skewed as the collection of musicians in the service’s catalog. Many of the errors I had to troubleshoot were related to the uneven nature of the catalog: early versions of the script were thrown into disarray when Spotify listed no related artists for a musician. On occasion, the API suggested a related artist who did not actually have an artist page in the system (often the case with new or less-established musicians). I massaged these gaps to make this particular exercise work (you’ll now get a tongue in cheek “Musical dead end” or “Artist deleted from Spotify” output for them), but the silences in the archive offer significant reminders of the commercial politics that go into generic and archival formation, particularly when an archive is proprietary. I can imagine tweaking things slightly to create a script that produces only those archival gaps, but that is work for another day. In the meantime, I’ll be trying to figure out how Kanye West might be considered Christmas music.

For my fellowship in the Scholars’ Lab this year I’ll be working with Eric to expand a project we began last year on Virginia Woolf and natural language processing. My dissertation focuses on sound recordings and modernism, and this year I will focus on how Woolf’s quotation marks offer evidence of her engagement with sound as a textual device. In my reading, the quotation mark is the most obvious point at which sound meets text, the most heavily used sound recording technology in use by writers. Patterns in quotation mark usage across large corpora can tell us a lot about the role that sound plays in literature, but, as you might expect, there are lots of quotation marks - hundreds or thousands in any given text. Computational methods can help us make sense of the vast number and turn them into reasonable objects of study.
You can find more information in this post about my thinking on quotation marks and some preliminary results from thinking about them in relation to Woolf. As I discuss there, finding quotation marks in a text is not especially challenging, but this year Eric and I will be focusing on a particular wrinkle in Woolf’s use of the marks, best conveyed in The Hours, Michael Cunningham’s late-century riff on Virginia Woolf. In The Hours, Cunningham offers a fictionalized version of Woolf meditating on her composition process:

She passes a couple, a man and woman younger than herself, walking together, leisurely, bent towards each other in the soft lemon-colored glow of a streetlamp, talking (she hears the man, “told me something something something in this establishment, something something, harrumph, indeed”) (166).

The repeated “somethings“ of the passage suggest the character’s imperfect experience of the conversation as well as the limits of her senses. As the moment is conveyed through the character’s perspective, the conversation will always be incomplete. Recording technology was largely unreliable during the early days of the twentieth century, and, similarly, the sound record of this conversation as given by the text is already degraded before we hear it. Cunningham points to how the sounded voice is given character in the ears of the listener, and, in a print context, in the pen of the writer. A printed voice can speak in a variety of ways and in a variety of modes.
Cunningham’s passage contains echoes of what will eventually be the famous first sentence of Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway: “Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.” The text implies that Mrs. Dalloway speaks, but it does not mark it as such: the same conversational tone in Cunningham remains here, but the narrator does not differentiate sound event from narrative by using quotation marks. We see moments of indirect speech like this all the time, when discourse becomes submerged in the texture of the narrative, but it doesn’t disappear entirely. Speech implies a lot: social relations, the thoughts of a speaking body, among others. Things get muddy when the line between narrative voice and speech becomes unclear. If quotation marks imply a different level of speech than unquoted speech, might they also imply changes in the social relations they represent?
Mrs. Dalloway is filled with moments like these, and this year I’ll be working to find ways to float them to the surface of the text. Examining these moments can tell us how conversation changes during the period, what people are talking about and for, how we conceive of the limits of print and sound, and about changing priorities in literary aesthetics. The goal this year is to train the computer to identify moments like this, moments that a human reader would be able to parse as spoken but that are not marked as such. Our first pass will be to work with the quoted material, which we can easily identify to build a series of trigger words that Woolf uses to flag speech as sound (said, asked, called, etc.). With this lexicon, we can then look for instances in her corpus where they pop up without punctuation. Teaching the computer to classify these passages correctly will be a big task, and this process alone will offer me lots of new material to work with as I untangle the relationship between modernist print and sound. In upcoming posts I’ll talk more about the process of learning natural language processing and about some preliminary results and problems. Stay tuned!

[This week I presented at the 2015 Huskey Research Exhibition at UVA. The talk was delivered from very schematic notes, but below is a rough recreation of what I discussed. The talk I gave is a crash course in a new project I’ve started working on with the generous help of the Scholars’ Lab that thinks about sound in Virginia Woolf’s career using computational methods. Eric Rochester, especially, has been endlessly giving of his time and expertise, helping me think through and prototype work on this material. The talk wound up receiving first prize for the digital humanities panel of which I was a part. The project is still very much inchoate, and I’d welcome thoughts on it.
When I talk to you, you make certain assumptions about me as a person based on what you’re hearing. You decide whether or not I might be worth paying attention to, and you develop a sense of our social relations based around the sound of my voice. The voice conveys and generates assumptions about the body and about power: am I making myself heard? Am I registering as a speaking voice? Am I worth listening to?

The human microphone, made famous by Occupy Wall Street, nicely encapsulates the social dimensions of sound that interest me: one person speaks, and the people around her repeat what she says more loudly, again and again, amplifying the human voice without technology. Sound literally moves through multiple bodies and structures the social relations between people, and the whole movement is an attempt to make a group of people heard by those who would rather not listen.
As a literary scholar, I am interested in how texts can speak in similar ways. The texts we read frequently contain large amounts of speech within them: conversations, monologues, poetic voice, etc. We talk about sound in texts all the time, and the same social and political dimensions of sound still remain even if a text appears silent on the page. If who can be heard and who gets to speak are both contested questions in the real world, they continue to structure our experiences of printed universes.
All of this brings me to the quotation mark. The humble piece of punctuation does a lot of work for us every day, and I want to think more closely about how it can help us understand how texts speak. The quotation mark is the most obvious point at which sound meets text. Computational methods tend to focus on the vocabulary of a text as the building blocks of meaning, but they can also help us turn quotation marks into objects of inquiry. Quotation marks can tell us a lot about how texts engage with the human voice, but there are lots of them in texts. Digital methods can help us make sense of the scale.

I examine Virginia Woolf’s quotation marks, in particular, for a number of reasons. Aesthetically, we can see her bridging the Victorian and modernist literary periods, though she tends to fall in with the latter of the two. Politically, she lived through periods of intense social and political upheaval at the beginning of the twentieth century. Very few recordings of Woolf remain, but she nonetheless thought deeply about sound recording. The worldwide market for gramophones exploded during her lifetime, and her texts frequently featured technologies of sound reproduction. Woolf’s gramophones frequently malfunction in her novels, and I’m interested in seeing how her quotation marks might analogously be irregular or broken intentionally. Woolf is especially good for thinking about punctuation marks in this way: she owned a printing press, and she often set type herself.
The following series of histograms gives a rough estimation of how Woolf’s use of quotation changes over the course of her career. On GitHub  you can find the script I’ve been working on with Eric to generate these results. The number of quotations is plotted on the y-axis against their position in the novel on the x-axis, so each histogram represents more quoted speech with higher bars and more concentrated darknesses. If you have an especially good understanding of a particular novel, Mrs. Dalloway, say, you could pick out moments of intense conversation based on sudden spikes in the number of quotations. The histograms are organized in such a way that to read chronologically through Woolf’s career you would read left to right line by line, as you would the text of a book. The top-left histogram is Woolf’s earliest novel, the bottom-right corner her last.
     
To my eye, the output suggests high concentrations of conversation in the novels at the beginning and ending of Woolf’s career. We can see that her middle period, especially, appears to have a significant decrease in the amount of quoted speech. In one sense, this might make sense to someone familiar with Woolf’s career. Her first two novels feel more typically Victorian in their aesthetics, and she really gets into the thick of modernist experiment with her third novel. One way we often describe the shift from Victorian to the modernist period is as a shift inward, away from society and towards the psychology of the self. So it makes sense that we might see the amount of conversation between multiple speaking bodies significantly fall away over the course of those novels. The seventh histogram is especially interesting, because it suggests the least amount of speech of anything in her corpus. But if we visualize things a different way, we see that this novel, The Waves, actually shows a huge spike in punctuated speech. This graph represents the percentage of each text that is contained within quotation marks, the amount of text represented as punctuated speech.

This might look like a problem with the data: how could the text with the fewest number of quotations also have the highest percentage of quoted speech? But the script is actually giving me exactly what I asked for: The Waves is a series of monologues by six disembodied voices, and the amount of non-speech text is extremely small. More generally, charting the percentage of quoted speech in the corpus appears to support my general readings of the original nine histograms: roughly three times as much punctuated speech in the early novels as in the middle period, with a slight leveling off in the end of her career.
We could think of The Waves as an anomaly, but I think it more clearly calls for a revision of such a reading of speech in Woolf’s career. The spike in quoted speech is a hint that there is something else going on in Woolf’s work. Perhaps we can use the example of The Waves to propose that there might be a range of discourses, of types of speech in Woolf’s corpus. Before I suggested that speech diminished in the middle of Woolf’s career, but that’s not exactly true. My suspicion is that it just enters a different mode. Consider these two passages, both quoted from Mrs. Dalloway:

Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. 
Times without number Clarissa had visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home. Was Evelyn ill again? Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome, perfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always, but presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend, Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify.

In each case, the text implies speech by Mrs. Dalloway and by Hugh without marking it as such with punctuation marks. Discourse becomes submerged in the texture of the narrative, but it doesn’t disappear entirely. Moments like these suggest a range of discourses in Woolf’s corpus: dialogue, monologue, conversation, punctuated, implied, etc. All of these speech types have different implications, but it’s difficult to get a handle on them because of their scale. I began the project by simply trying to mark down moments of implied speech in Mrs. Dalloway by hand. Once I got to about two hundred, it seemed like it was time to ask the computer for help.
The current plan moving forward is to build a corpus of test passages containing both quoted speech and implied speech, train a python script against this set of passages, and then use this same script to search for instances of implied speech throughout Woolf’s corpus. Theoretically, at least, the script will search for a series of words that flag text as implied speech to a human reader - said, recalled, exclaimed, etc. Using this lexicon as a basis, the script would then pull out the context surrounding these words to produce a database of sentences meant to serve as speech. At Eric’s suggestion, I’m currently exploring the Natural Language Toolkit to take a stab at all of this. My own hypothesis is that there will be an inverse relationship between quoted speech and implied speech in her corpus, that the amount of speech left unflagged by quotation marks will increase in the middle of Woolf’s career. Once I have all this material, I’ll be able to subject the results to further analysis and to think more deeply about speech in Woolf’s work. Who speaks? What about? What counts as a voice, and what is left in an ambiguous, unsounded state?
The project is very much in its beginning stages, but it’s already opening up the way that I think about speech in Woolf’s text. It tries to untangle the relationship between our print record and our sonic record, and further work will help show how discourse is unfolding over time in the modernist period.

I am pleased to announce that “Moving People, Linking Lives: An Interdisciplinary Symposium” will take place March 20-21, 2015 at the University of Virginia. Friday, March 20 events will take place in the Kaleidoscope Room. Saturday, March 21 events will take place in Alderman 421 except for an evening reception, location to be determined.
Presentations and workshops will open dialogue across different fields, periods, and methods, from textual interpretation to digital research. Invited participants include specialists on narrative theory and life writing, prosopography or comparative studies of life narratives in groups, and the diverse field of digital humanities or computer-assisted research on cultural materials, from ancient texts to Colonial archives, from printed books to social media.
Invited participants include: Elton Barker, Jason Boyd, James Phelan, Susan Brown, Margaret Cormack, Courtney Evans, Will Hanley, Ben Jasnow, Ruth Page, Sue Perdue, Sidonie Smith. We hope to have lots of locals involved with digital work participate as well, and we particularly encourage graduate students to join in for the weekend!
Our symposium will bridge the gaps among our fields; share the innovations of several digital projects; and welcome the skeptical or the uninitiated, whether in our historical fields or in the applications of technology in the humanities. Booth, Clay, and Ogden have each led digital projects with some common themes and aims: locating, identifying, and interpreting the narratives—or very often, the lack of discursive records—about individuals in groups or documents, in Homer or other ancient text, Medieval French hagiography, and nineteenth-century printed collections of biographies in English. We want to open discussion of many potential methods including our own—data mining and digital editions of texts; relational databases and historical timelines and maps—for research on groups of interlinked persons, narratives or data about their lives, and documents or other records, and synthesizing and visualizing this research in accessible ways that reach students and the public. Digital innovation, however, should be informed by traditions of scholarly interpretation and advanced theoretical insights and commitments. Narrative theory and Theory generally, ideological critique including studies of gender and race, textual and book history studies, transnational and social historiography, philology and language studies, archeology, cultural geography and critical cartography, are all gaining influence on digital projects.
Invited participants will be posting about their research to our blog in the weeks leading up to the symposium, anyone is free to comment on the posts. In addition, our participants will be building a Zotero-powered bibliography in the weeks leading up to the symposium full of rich materials related to the event’s discussion.
Organized and hosted by Alison Booth, Jenny Strauss Clay, and Amy Odgen and sponsored by the Page Barbour Committee, the departments of English, French, and Art, the Institute for Humanities and Global Cultures, the Scholars’ Lab and Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, and other entities at UVa, all events are free and open to the public. More information can be found on the blog as planning progresses, and you can follow us on twitter at @livesdh.
Join in the conversation on the blog at movingpeoplelinkinglives.org, and we hope to see many come out for fruitful interchange in March!

I have been touting the use of Prism in the university classroom for some time now, but a recent exchange with Annie Swafford suggested to me that it might be worth explicitly outlining how I would go about doing so. With that in mind, I’ve composed the following set of questions for how I might frame discussion of Prism in the classroom. I’ve admittedly only had very brief chances to implement the tool in the classroom myself, so the thoughts come largely out of speculation and conversation. It should be noted as well that I assume below that you have already chosen a text and categories along which it should be marked (I may write on ways to approach such choices at a later date). In what follows, I move from general questions that I think would be helpful in framing any discussion of the tool to a particular use-case in James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The former questions inform and engage my latter use-case.
I prepare for class discussion by assembling a list of questions to be explored, and I would organize a Prism discussion around two lines of inquiry: tool-specific and visualization-specific. Some of these questions can be helpful for framing your own thoughts. Others could usefully be posed to the class as a whole as a means of framing discussion.
Tool-Specific Questions
How do the tool and our framing of it affect how we read the text? How is Prism’s mode of reading different from what we normally do? Is it the same that we’ve always been doing – close reading in a different form? What are the problems with the form? Can we really boil interpretation down to a series of numbers, visualize it, and move forward? Or is there more to interpretation than that? How do individual interpretations join in with the group reading? How much is the interpretive process encapsulated in the marking of a text? The visualization? The conversation that follows? How do the terms you choose for highlighting (the facets) guide the experience of reading the text? How do the explanations you provide for those terms affect the marking experience? When do the terms break down? If the terms propose a binary, what happens to that opposition over the course of the experience?
Visualization-Specific Questions
Which passages were marked the least for a particular category? The most? Why in either case? Which passages were particularly contentious, marked in many different ways? Where do particular categories cluster? How does the visualization show a relationship between the categories? How does your own interpretation link up to the collected visualization produced by the tool? Do the two visualizations tell us anything meaningful? Would we be able to find these meanings on our own? How does the visualization reflect the interpretive process? Why might we care more about a particular visualization for a particular reading? How is the quantified version of interpretation that Prism generates distinct from what we might learn from a discussion on our own? Can we imagine limits to this approach?
The primary job of an instructor using Prism is to help the students connect the results of the tool to the larger discussions encapsulated by the marking categories. Look at the results with a skeptical eye and ask how they can be meaningfully related to the ideas and provocations of the marking categories. My favorite early use of Prism asked users to mark James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man along the categories of “modernism” and “realism.” In a class, I would intersperse observations based on the visualizations with a discussion of the passage and the two marking categories. What do we mean by modernism? By realism? How is each expressed at the level of the text? What do we mean by literary experiment? By fragment? By realist details? What different genres does the text move through? Does the text construct a coherent narrative?
Putting realism and modernism alongside one another in Prism forces students to reconsider the binary, which quickly breaks down in practice. We can talk about whole novels or poems as belonging to one or another category, but can we do the same for individual sentences? For words? 80% of users at the time of this writing believe that the first word of the excerpt, “once,” is modernist. But why? If you look at the winning facet visualization, people seem primarily to be marking whole passages as one category – they are interpreting realism and modernism in chunks, not in terms of individual words. Readers tend to mark as modernist those generic changes where the excerpt suddenly adopts the form of nursery rhyme or of a fairy tale, suggesting that it is not any one genre but the shift between several in rapid succession that readers find to be modernist. The font size visualization suggests that those passages referencing physical actions by people are more likely to be associated with realist: “His father told him that story” and “When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold” are marked as being especially realist. With this observation in hand, why these details? Why are the body and the bodily detail markers of a realism? Why might an association with the family suggest realism? How do they come under pressure in the face of aesthetic experiment?
Obviously these suggestions are just beginnings for how to approach Prism in the classroom. Many other fascinating examples have already surfaced, particularly those that use the tool to teach basic reading and foreign language skills. Get in touch if you have used the tool in your classroom! I would love to hear how you did so.

This past year the Scholars’ Lab has implemented many performance upgrades and bug fixes for Prism. The most recent upgrade is particularly exciting: users can now deploy their own personal Prism installations to Heroku with the click of a button. Well - it will take the click of a button and a few other commands. I’ve added a section detailing just how to do so under the “Deploy to Heroku” section of the Prism Github’s readme.
It was already possible to implement private user communities by marking uploaded prism games as “unlisted” and then distributing the links to your group of participants. The Heroku deploy function makes this process a bit easier by allowing to users to host all of their games in one place. The process also sets you up well to tinker with the Prism codebase using a live app, as Heroku provides instructions for cloning the app to your desktop.
All of this on the heels of another exciting announcement: the Praxis Program has a short article on Prism appearing in the Digital Humanities 2013 special conference issue of Literary and Linguistic Computing. In the piece, we summarize Prism’s and interventions into conversations on crowdsourcing with special reference to its user interface.
It’s a good day to e-highlight!

Last week Sarah and I drove to Washington and Lee University as part of a new collaboration enabled by a grant from the Associated Colleges of the South. As part of the endeavor, Scholars’ Lab fellows are guest teaching pieces of an Introduction to Digital Humanities course. Our task, in particular, was to co-teach for a day on the topics of project management and software development. While we each took part and taught in both conversations, Sarah took the lead on the former topic and I took the latter.
I can’t rave enough about the experience enough, so I’ve organized my thoughts into three sections below.
Undergraduates + Digital Humanities = Dynamite
I am endlessly delighted by the reactions of undergraduates when they get introduced to the digital humanities. In virtually every case, I have encountered students hungry to learn the material. The W&L students were no exceptions. We found students ready to learn, eager to participate, and wiling to ask hard questions about the affordances and limitations of the field. You can find reflections by the students on their course blog. What’s more, the Washington and Lee students stand poised to make real contributions to digital scholarship. They have worked up some really interesting projects on the history of coeducation at W&L and on the changing vision and reality for Robert E. Lee’s Chapel on the university grounds.
Co-Teaching
Sarah and I work well together, and we have presented together in the past. But we had not taught together before the Washington and Lee trip. Full disclosure: I adore everything about co-teaching. It immediately disrupts the one-way transmission of information from the instructors to the students and forces the conversation to be more collaborative; co-teaching allows you to occupy simultaneously and more obviously the dual roles of student and teacher. It takes the pressure off any one person to keep the ship sailing smoothly, which empowers and enlivens the conversation. Co-teaching seems especially well-suited to the digital humanities, which value collaboration and play. Seminar discussions and workshops are different from working on teams to build projects, but co-instructors can make the experience a bit more lab-like, a bit more collaborative.
Teaching DH!
It is one thing to learn and practice digital humanities. It is another thing entirely to turn around and help others do the same. I have only really been hacking away for two years now, so I felt a bit unqualified to talk down software development as an invited speaker. I tend to assume that the Scholars’ Lab has a better sense of my own abilities than I do in most cases, though, and the invitation to W&L was no exception. The practice of putting together presentations on project management and software development was incredibly empowering. It helped me to have more confidence in myself as a digital humanist. No longer does the prospect of teaching an introduction to digital humanities course appear to be a vague and nebulous question mark. I now know that I could do it, because I have already done so in part. I also have a better sense of my own developing pedagogy of digital humanities. Opportunities to teach digital humanities like this, to perform with no net, are rare.
You teach to learn, and this is as true in the digital humanities as it is anywhere else. I learned a great deal from the bright undergraduates at W&L.

The following was co-authored and co-hacked with Claire.
Claire and I went to the Arduino Hackday hosted by the Scholars’ Lab on Friday. We had no idea what we were getting into, which made it all the more fun. Jeremy brought in a bunch of Arduino kits of all shapes and sizes, and various people went to work to see what they could make out of them.
First Claire and I got a blinking light to work. From there we decided to skip several chapters to make a little music player using a piezo speaker component. At that point we went off the map, dreaming big and working off the page. We started out working with this schematic, but we wanted to expand things a little.
I apologize in advance for whatever vocabulary gap there might be in the discussion below; it was my first time coding in C.
For one, this set-up only uses a single octave major scale. We opened things up by expanding the range of tones the speaker could play, including both a chromatic scale and adding an extra octave. One difficulty here was in the way that way that accidentals would be read by the board. At first we tried to use standard notation – f sharp would be represented by f#. But the code finds the notes in the melody by reading character by character through an array. So when the computer sees “cc#”, it processes it as two ‘c’s and one nonsense syllable that it can’t process. There is probably a more elegant solution, but we got around this by associating the accidentals with new characters entirely
C#/Db             =>       l

D#/Eb              =>       m

F#/Gb              =>       n

G#/Ab             =>       o

A#/Bb             =>       p

Next, we added an extra octave. To extend the range, we hard coded frequencies for the new notes according to the formula given by the original Arduino code:
timeHigh = period / 2 = 1 / (2 * toneFrequency)
We probably could have done this in a more dynamic way. Or, as Eric and Ronda showed, we could have just downloaded a tone library to do this for us. They were jamming out to the Star Wars theme while we were still trying to get things working.  But eventually, we were able to program in the opening of “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” Mozart’s Lacrimosa, John Coltrane’s “26-2,” and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”
Here is where things got really ambitious, we came up with the idea to incorporate a RGB LED light that would change colors each time there was a note change in “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” Rainbow lights for a song about rainbows.
To get the light working we worked off a slightly modified version of this schematic, mashed in with the piezo tutiorial. With some quick help from Eric, we modified the light arrangement so that each generates a random RGB combination. We then synchronized this with the rhythm of the melody.
In terms of the actual circuitry, we just split the digital signal so that it went out to two different parts of the bread board simultaneously and then fed information to both pins. Later we added a volume knob to reduce the maddening noise. You can see attached photos below, though you’ll have to meet us halfway with our diagram of the breadboard.
A later, unsuccessful attempt to key each frequency to a particular color resulted in a light that got brighter or darker depending on the note. I think with a little more time I could fix that by hard coding particular RGB values to particular frequencies, but we were trying to do it dynamically by converting the frequency directly into an intensity value.
Behold our final product!

The biggest issue that I have faced with my work with the Praxis Program has to do with how I judge the difficulty of the tasks before me. I have proven to be singularly inadequate at distinguishing quick fixes with a large payoff from larger problems that would yield only small utility. This issue surfaced early on, when I boldly suggested that I could implement Omniauth in a week. Two and a half months later I am still trying to get it to work: the Omniauth code structure works more generally, but each authentication service is its own unique little snowflake, different from all the other snowflakes in the code breaking eccentricities that it brings to the table. We had to jettison Twitter early on because it would not return user emails, which are central to the way that Devise handles logins. Facebook worked on local rails servers, but something whacky is happening on staging (and in deployment, for that matter) so that it throws a redirect uri failure at us that did not appear before. I feel as though I could have pounded away at these problems for ages and gotten nowhere.
But for every task like Omniauth there have been other jobs that seemed large but turned out to be much easier than expected. I implemented a destroy function on prisms last week in just a couple of hours (Shane had already provided a lot of the scaffolding on an older database setup), which meant that I also had to implement user roles and permissions using cancan. Cancan felt like a bigger job than it wound up being, and the whole thing seems to be working in the feature branch now. Now a user can delete a prism that they have uploaded. Great success!
I think this ability to distinguish between large and small tasks is something that can only come with time and experience. We Praxers may be unable to tell how much work a particular feature will require, but the SLab team has been incredibly helpful in that regard. Where we see mountains, they see molehills, and vice versa. And when you get right down to it, Prism seemed like the biggest mountain of all a couple months ago. Prism felt like an insurmountable task until last week when everything came together in a flurry of productivity. I am impressed with what we have done.
Now, without warning, a couple of inspirational climbing videos.

In writing the following post, I was struck by how close it felt to one Alex Gil wrote last year about a similar Prism disaster that he called the herokulypse. Alex wrote his post on April 23 of last year, so we’re a few days ahead of schedule for apocalyptic project events.
–
Over the past few weeks the Praxers have been diligently working on their own pieces of Prism. Gwen and Cecilia have been making strides with design, Chris has worked on highlighting and now visualizing, Shane has been doggedly attacking user uploads, and I worked on pieces of Omniauth, design, and uploads. On Monday we made our first attempt to really put things back together, and the result was pretty horrific.
My sense was that we had all broken Prism a little bit in our own special way. Some of these broken pieces weren’t really noticeable until we combined everything back together, when suddenly Prism became a big goopy mess. CSS was screwed up, the databases didn’t work right, migrations were failing, and the basic functionality of the highlight tool erupted as whole pages somehow morphed into copies of other pages. The crisis was mitigated thanks to the swift responses of Wayne and Jeremy, and things seem to be working again.
A lot of this could have been mitigated, I think, if we had better coordinated our feature branches. Instead, a lot of us were working on a big feature branch: “user uploads” or “omniauth.” It would have been better to break those out into smaller pieces so that any damage from merging would be manageable and less the nightmarish event that ensued. An “omniauth” branch could become multiple branches, one each for Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.
Admittedly, some of the work that we have been doing has been of the sort that I don’t think you can really divide up easily. Shane and I have been working on refactoring the databases, and large scale changes like that seem like they should happen all at once. Even so, I think we could have found ways to organize our work better. This would have, of course, necessitated better planning on our part ahead of time.
Surprise: the SLab gurus have been telling us all along to make more and smaller feature branches.
Listen to your digital elders. They know all the things.

After several weeks of grinding away with the generous help of Eric and Shane, Omniauth works with our current setup. Now a user can arrive at our site and log into the system using their Facebook or Google accounts as an alternative to creating their own Prism-specific login.
One significant difficulty we encountered was how to handle multiple authentications. In the default framework, the system creates a new user when you authenticate through a service. So, if a user clicks on Facebook authentication, that action creates a new user in the database. If that same user comes back and clicks Twitter instead, that user will then have a separate account unlinked to the first in the database. Rather than implement an authentication management system, we decided to add a disclaimer to the myPrisms page directing users to login with the correct accounts if they aren’t seeing the information that they expect.
Another difficulty: initially we also wanted to include Twitter authentication, but Twitter returns only the user’s nickname instead of an email. This is a problem for Devise, the gem that we use to handle the logins more generally. Devise has emails pretty firmly integrated into their framework, and things got quite whacky when we tried to disable email as the verifying function for new users. We successfully did so, but each new success raised new problems related to the nickname/email interactions. At length, we decided just to go with Facebook and Google for now. Any future authentications that we implement will be chosen based on whether or not they return user emails.
Next, I’ll be helping Shane move forward with allowing User Uploads.

As we gear up for Prism development proper, I have been trying to get up to speed with some coding basics so that I can hit the ground running. Here are the learning aids that I have found most useful over the past couple weeks. Nearly all of these materials can be found in the Praxis Program’s scratchpad.
Ruby
Learn Ruby the Hard Way - I enjoyed the learning approach here: the site displays a chunk of code that you type out, fix, and then examine more closely. It might seem like working backwards, but it works well for people who learn by doing.
Ruby Warrior - Learn Ruby by programming your own video game! There is nothing quite like tricking your brain to work. Each new level presents a problem that you must solve by changing a Ruby file. This one is great for learning the syntax, but it will only go so far in teaching the methods available to you in Ruby. You’ll be doing a lot of methods unique to the game, and I doubt that warrior.walk!(:backward) will come up in normal situations. Syntax is all, though.
Rails
Michael Hartl’s Ruby on Rails Tutorial - Hartl walks you through building an application step by step via a Rails scaffolding. They are quite thorough and easy to follow.
RailsCasts - These very short video tutorials walk you through Ruby on Rails concepts with screencasts and commentary.
JavaScript
Code Academy - I’ve been using Code Academy for JavaScript, but they also have HTML, Ruby, Python, and several other coding tracks. There are a wealth of resources here arranged in interactive exercises, and the site also has lots of extra opportunities for practice once you finish the main courses. It also gives out points and badges as you code for added incentive!

As we move into the second half of our tenure on the Praxis squad, we are feeling the pressure to start actually making something. To that end, the SLab crew asked us to make a list of our priorities for Prism. Hopefully this will help us make a to do list in the coming weeks. The following was the list that seemed to come out of yesterday’s meeting, though it’s possible that other people could have gotten different impressions from the conversation.
These seem to be our priorities, in no particular order except roughly that in which they were brought up:
Types of texts - we’re interested in opening up the Prism framework to deal with pictures, music, etc.
Getting a crowd - we want to get a large group of people working with Prism, however that might be arranged.
Visualizations - we’re interested in expanding Prism’s visualizations to allow you to see the individual set of markings in relation to the crowd and to let you see one marking category’s visualization beside another.
User uploads - we want to make it possible for users/instructors to upload a text for marking themselves, which we see as essential for classroom use.
Complicating the sense of how we highlight - there has been discussion of complicating how the marking system works, allowing for a limit to the number of markings or a type of marking economy that is distributed across your selections to encourage different types of engagement with the data.
Design makeover - we want to remake the design of the site with an eye to usability.
I think my own priorities lie in making it possible for users to upload their own texts for marking and in possibly adding more visualizations. If forced to choose between the two, I would spend the time on making the tool capable of handling user uploads. As quickly became clear, any one of these goals spins off into dozens of other questions. What do we mean by “upload a text”? Will those texts be public? Private? How will we navigate copyright and fair use? In the coming days we’re aiming to get a sense of our collective ordering of the list.

I just recently posted my experiment with making a Ruby program that you can use for doing your own grading. I have since made several improvements upon the first draft of the code, so I present to you Ruby Grading 2.0.
The changes:
1) I converted the code to incorporate classes, which was a huge learning process for me that involved lots of troubleshooting. I think I am starting to get the hang of classes and understand their importance. The conversion process was nightmarish, but they allow you to be a lot more flexible when trying to include new tasks. Plus, I learned a lot from the ordeal.
2) I made it so that you can now input your entire roster into the grading program and calculate all your final grades there. You only input the syllabus parameters once, at the beginning. The program saves these and then applies them to all the students on your list. At the end it will spit out a nice little list of students’ names and their final percentage grades.
3) I also tweaked several small things as I went to account for differing input situations. Before the program couldn’t account for certain types of input. For example, if you typed in “three” and not “3” when prompted for the number of assignments, the program would break. I still am not quite sure how best to deal with those sorts of situations; I couldn’t really find a satisfactory test for whether or not input was convertible to an integer or not, so I think I invented one that seems to work (see lines 136-141 of the code). My test:

I cast the input string to an integer. If the integer is greater than one the code works. If not, something has gone wrong (who assigns fewer than one assignments), and it will ask for the input as an integer. It works, but it feels like a particularly dirty way of doing things. Next up, three things if I should continue: 1) Make it so that quizzes can be dynamically inputted into the program interface, with the possibility to drop the lowest one if necessary. 2) Consider making a version of the program that reads out of other files so that you don’t have to do all your grading in one session. After all, we keep our gradebooks as we go, so this information is all typed somewhere else. It seems like the biggest time save would be to have it open a file, examine its contents, and spit out a calculated final grade for you. 3) Maybe include a method that will convert the percentages to letter grades.

Chris recently posted his very exciting experiment that uses Ruby to create music theory worksheets for his students. Inspired by this, I have been playing around on Ruby with much more modest aims: I wanted to use Ruby to do my grading for me. I always do my grading with an Excel spreadsheet and a series of formulas. I am not particularly skilled at that interface, though, and it usually takes me a while to get it to work right. I thought I might as well try to do the same thing in Ruby. Admittedly, this idea also came from Chris: he has been claiming that such a thing was a very real possibility for weeks now.
Here is the source code. It’s a fairly rudimentary interface at this point, but it does seem to work. It allows you to compute a student’s final grade in a course where assignment types are weighted differently.
I hope to keep tinkering with this over time. Some things that I would want to include in later versions:
1) Clean up the code. I don’t feel very comfortable with classes at the moment, so I bend over backwards to accommodate that lack. I think the first step to making this more dynamic and workable will be to class it up. Right now the code only runs straight down, start to finish. Organizing the code in a more dynamic way will allow the program to be more workable to a variety of circumstances, which leads into my second point.
2) Make the interface more flexible for a variety of types of course arrangements. Right now, it’s really only set up to work for a certain type of class with a few types of assignments. I have it set up so that you input the number of different types of assignments you have, ex: paper one, paper two, midterm, and final. But there isn’t really a way to account for multiple smaller assignments that make up a larger chunk of grading, like individual quizzes as part of a larger whole. Right now you would have to average the quiz grades ahead of time and then enter the composite grade in as one lump “quizzes” category. That also means that, if you want to drop the lowest quiz grade, you have to do that on your own. Also, the program completes its run after completing the grade for one student.
My priority right now was making it work for my purposes - a class with less than twenty students and a limited number of assignments. It seems to work for that. Take a shot at breaking it.

Since Gwen just posted her solution to the Fizz Buzz homework assignment,  I thought that I would throw mine up here as well. Here is my solution.
It’s pretty similar to Gwen’s take on the problem. I just switched the order of a couple things and used a couple shortcuts. I also apparently have a penchant for extra parentheses to help organize things.
I do feel like I perhaps missed the point of the exercise, given that it was tacked onto Wayne’s discussion of object-oriented programming and classes. Perhaps we were meant to solve this problem using that approach? In any case, there is no one way to make breakfast; I’ll take my approach for now, until I have a better grasp of object-oriented programming. I’ll use what I know.

I just recently hopped on Twitter for the first time as part of a conference through UVA’s Institute for the Humanities and Global Cultures. It was a bit rough for the first five or six tweets as I worked out the kinks. Here are some thoughts that came out of the experience.
I am hooked on tweeting conference presentations. I was a bit worried that tweeting would be too distracting during a talk, but I actually found that it made me a better listener. I was forced to listen hard to find discernible takeaways, which helped me to digest the information being thrown at me. Also, it gave me a way to occupy my wandering attention in a productive way. Tweeting also seems like a good way to extend the life of the conference after the proceedings are complete.
On that same note, the SLab crew has had a few conversations about how Twitter interacts with intellectual property. I felt obligated to assign many tweets I made to a particular person, assuming that I was giving credit where it was due. If our labor is intellectual, I wanted to do my best to make sure that I didn’t obscure the architect of a particular idea. I wonder, though, if conference attendees would rather not be held permanently accountable for comments they make during a question and answer session. Is Twitter in this form a form of publishing? Do you need someone’s permission to post their thoughts in the Twitterverse?
I also find Twitter interesting for the amount of access it gives you to people and groups that you might not otherwise be able reach. Tweeting can put you in touch with so many people that would be otherwise inaccessible. It’s really quite incredible - I’ve heard several stories now of people who got jobs or made industry contacts that were completely unexpected simply by shooting some messages out into the ether. I don’t have an personal experience like this just yet, but I will keep you posted.
A question: what is tweeting etiquette - more generally but also in the context of tweeting conference presentations? How many tweets are appropriate? I was averaging five or six tweets per talk, but I noticed that other people tweeting the conference were doing far fewer. I could not help but feel that my loyal followers (all four of you) were being bombarded by my messages about global cultures.
It remains to be seen how much I will tweet in my everyday life, but I think I will use it for conferences from now on. Follow me - @walshbr

It’s been a tad quiet on the blog front over the past couple weeks. Here is what the Praxis squad has been up to.
It’s been a great week for collaborative writing. We put together a poster abstract for DH 2013 that crystallized a lot of our thoughts on Prism and crowdsourcing thus far. Perhaps we will see some of our loyal readers there? The poster abstract that we put together discusses crowdsourcing as a continuum from more mechanical interaction to forms that maintain more of a sense of the autonomous individual. We concluded by conceiving of a few different types of interfaces for Prism and the ways in which they might affect the nature of the crowdsourcing process. Much of the abstract was put together with multiple people writing different parts of the document at the same time, which I thought was an interesting enactment of the sorts of questions and issues that we have been working through. It was great to see each person’s piece combined into the whole. Special shout-out to Gwen for taking the lead on the abstract coordination/writing and to Jeremy for his expert wisdom.
Part of the reason for radio silence has been a distinct shift in our day to day work. After finishing the poster abstract, Wayne and company started hitting us hard and fast with code boot camp. So far we’ve dipped into command line, git, and ruby on rails. Things are going pretty well so far - it feels a little like taking a giant cyber-multivitamin as we prepare to put all of our plans for Prism into action in the next few months. When asked to explain git and version control, I like to do so by comparing it to time travel without the risk of creating a universe collapsing paradox. For next week we are moving through the first ten exercises of Learn Ruby the Hard Way. The idea is that you type out letter for letter a series of code, trouble shoot if it doesn’t run, and then reflect back on what you wrote. This seems a bit unusual - I would expect a more traditional format to teach you the concept first and then enact the code yourself. The LRTHW model works great for my personality type: I always have a hard time with training of any sort. Invariably in any new employee training, my attention immediately starts to wander as soon as my superior starts to explain something to me, and I always wind up learning by doing. So this reversed pedagogical model works well for me: I do first and then think back on the process. I can imagine it being very frustrating, though, if you are the kind of student that dutifully pays attention to the lesson on view.
It’s an interesting model, and I wonder if it could be adapted for the humanities. What might that entail? Maybe I could have my students type out an essay paragraph word for word and then reflect on it after the fact. Would the model still work, or is there something about humanities thinking that requires that the thinking/learning precede the doing?

Jeremy asked us to offer a Prism exercise that would take the tool in a new direction. Rather than expanding the tool’s parameters, I would like to think about how we can get a more nuanced understanding of the information it already collects. In what follows I offer a vaporware exercise that we will play in person, suggest some thoughts on the disciplinary and pedagogical questions it might answer, and I conclude with some suggestions for adapting the exercise for digital use.
The idea: rather than marking multiple categories, all participants mark a single category. Each person has his or her own unique marking color.
The text: The specific text is not important for this particular idea, but for the sake of the exercise I will use “The Weary Blues” by Langston Hughes
The marking: Other(s)
The research/pedagogical issues at stake: The exercise was designed with pedagogy in mind. In the final visualization, the color constellation tells us who marked what in a clearer way: red for Brandon, green for Cecilia, etc. This is absolutely vital if we are going to use the tool for pedagogical purposes. Rather than submerging the voices into a bundle of data with no way back, this approach allows us to see the overlap and disjunctures between different interpretations more clearly. In the vaporware version, we can’t really do this without pulling the transparencies apart again to see them individually, which destroys the collective image. By restoring clarity to the individual voice, we can more easily open up a conversation with students. What did a particular student mark? Why? How does this relate to the aggregate? How does a particular voice interact with the crowd? These discussions of individual vs crowd work particularly well for this textual example: the poem obsesses over the relation between speaker and musician, poetry and tradition, individual and community, etc. Just as scholars would discuss how the lines blur between individuals and groups of people in the poem, the marking activity can open a meta-discussion about the nature of our own marking activity as an intellectual endeavor – a collaborative one nonetheless comprised of individual gestures.
There is also a fairly selfish short-term application to this: it simplifies things. As Gwen mentioned, throwing together eight transparencies all marked for three different things comes across as a big glob of data. Maybe the above approach can declutter things for our short-term training as Prism initiates. In this vaporware experiment, a mark means one thing only—the color tells you who did it. One category might not mean fewer markings, but it would at least be easier for us to process with fewer different systems of meaning on the overhead. I imagine that this (hopefully) simplified exercise is something that we need to just get a sense of what sorts of conversations, interpretations, and gains can come out of Prism at all. In a similar manner, the current Prism visualization only deals with one marking at a time. You sort by marker, and you don’t see all the markings at once.
The above approach is designed for the vaporware transparency game, so it obviously only works with small groups of people. This makes me wonder if it is even a viable option for working with a “crowd.” It seems very useful for pedagogy, but would such a thing even be feasible with a class of 20 students? I don’t think so. You’d have to get a really big packet of markers and a very nuanced sense of the color pallet. So this is really an idea that needs the technology in order to function. Here is a variation on the idea behind this exercise that would work for the online tool.
Users mark as usual and go to visualize. Below or next to the list of markers, we have a dropdown menu with a list of the users. Mousing over a particular username causes their markings to appear in the text, allowing you to compare their markings with the crowd’s aggregate. How these individual markers are visualized in relation to the mass is up for debate. One idea to implement this would be to underline each word that the user marks: a really big word not underlined means that the user did not mark it, but a large portion of the crowd did. A small word underlined means that the user marked it, but the crowd did not. This is not a perfect system, so I’m open to ideas. And this doesn’t even begin to broach the question of how the sorts of conversations I imagine coming out of Prism can possibly emerge when users are not all in a single room together. But I do think this larger question of retaining the individual user’s gesture and their markings is an important one – a step towards retaining their voice and even their humanity, in just the sense that Claire references.

This week, the team has been throwing around a number of ideas as to how we can further develop Prism. I keep falling back on spatial metaphors to categorize the changes currently in play. I threw the following model onto the SLab white board, wherein I propose two types of changes: vertical and horizontal.

First, the vertical axis, those changes which work within the tool’s existing functionality. Some changes deepen a function already in place. The suggestions offered by last year’s team for other visualizations would fall into this category. A new visualization can offer a more dynamic interaction with a set of markings, but users are still engaging with the same dataset. The fundamental function of the tool would remain the same. These sorts of vertical changes offer a deeper, more robust mode of interaction with the operations that the tool can already carry out.
I oppose these to horizontal changes, which more fundamentally alter the number and types of things that a tool can do. We have talked a lot about carrying Prism into other media: music, images, and video. We have also talked about freeing up the controls on Prism, making it possible for users to upload their own texts or to hide the categories prior to marking. These sorts of modifications change the face of Prism more drastically, resulting in different data sets and new possibilities for the users.
These horizontal changes seem to carry the highest risk. As we discussed at our meeting last week, we risk diluting Prism’s identity if we try to add in too many features: a tool that can do anything might just be a tool that can do nothing effectively. The SLab crew also pointed out how some of our broadening changes might carry us into territory that has already been covered by other developers and other tools. At the same time, though, some of suggestions for horizontal growth are incredibly exciting. Taking Prism into other media, freeing up the controls – these changes could help Prism reach a broader audience by teaching it new tricks. I think we should take them seriously.
Of course, this horizontal/vertical distinction does not quite hold up under close scrutiny. I think it would be a mistake to think of depth-oriented changes as being somehow narrower than broader changes. A new visualization could fundamentally alter your relation to the data in such a way that it feels as though the functionality has altered entirely. No modification slots entirely into one or the other category, and the spatial metaphors might muddy the waters unnecessarily. All the same, I find the distinction helpful for mapping out the morphing shape of the Prism of the future.
So do we build depth, or do we broaden our base? Do we dig into the features already present, or do we add new ones? At what point does Prism cease to be Prism? What would Prism look like if we graphed it?

My first experience with Prism last spring brought something of an existential crisis along with it, when I was asked to mark my beloved A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in terms of realism/modernism:

He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
O, the wild rose blossoms
On the little green place.

Considering Portrait as a modernist novel was nothing new, but being asked to consider individual words in that context was altogether unsettling. Words like “tuckoo” and “moocow” are easy to mark as modernist, but “baby” is perfectly reasonable within a realist text; it only begins to feel experimental as a part of the larger phrase “baby tuckoo.” And how do we account for the two lines of verse, where the words themselves are not particularly experimental but the juxtaposition between prose and poetry creates just the sort of genre bending you would expect from modernism?
I think this very brief analysis tells us something very important about how we make meaning: interpretive choices depend not just on the words in the text but on perceived relationships among different textual groupings within the text as a whole. Part of the perceived value of a crowdsourcing tool like Prism comes from its ability to generate conversations about these interpretive decisions. I wonder, though, if we can include these conservations in the tool itself.
The obvious response to this perceived need would be to prompt users to justify each interpretive decision they make, but this seems undesirable. I expect that the interface would become unwieldy very quickly if we asked users to explain every marking that they make, and I imagine that the defensive posture this would engender in users could be inimical to the nature of the tool’s ethos.
Perhaps we could consider an opt-in approach, where we offer users the option to select a particular marking and offer a short explanation after marking and just before saving the highlights. Then these terms could be footnoted in some way for visualization. Perhaps we could even run some sort of thesaurus program to link similar explanations across different marked passages.
I don’t mean to imply that this is a flaw in the Prism’s design: I think one of the more mind expanding aspects of the tool is how it lays bare the process by which word transforms into meaning. I hope we can find a way to front-end this strength in the user interface.

In middle school I built a website about the seven wonders of the ancient world. Nothing fancy – just images and some links – and I never published it. Building a personal website over the past few days as per Jeremy’s request feels a bit like coming full circle. My HTML skills remain prepubescent at best, and my barebones site keeps the spirit of GeoCities in the early 1990’s alive and well. Check it out. http://walshbr.com/old-site/.
I admit to some hesitation in posting this fledgling site for all to see: so much more could be done to bring it into the twenty-first century. But I keep coming back to Bethany’s encouragement last week to fail in public, advice with which I am in love. My graduate training thus far has emphasized polish and perfection, for clear and obvious reasons. But even at this early stage, my work with Praxis feels more electric knowing that mistakes are welcome and that failure is viewed as a space of experimentation and elaboration rather than embarrassment.
I cannot imagine any sort of collaborative activity (teaching included) that would not benefit from a healthy injection of interpersonal risk. We can’t really work together until we know each other, and that depth of knowledge only comes from admitting that we don’t have all the answers and that we don’t always succeed. Opening yourself up to such failures and recognizing their importance as part of any process is a necessary step towards collaboration that is more honest and certainly more human.
A promise for you out there in the ether: by the end of the year I will have turned failing into an art form. I’m sure in May I will look back on this early site with disdain and an eye to incorporating all sorts of tech wizardry. Maybe I’ll add a GIF. For now, I’m off to break the Internet.

For some time now I have led a double life as a musician and book lover. As a third year PhD in the English department at UVA, I work primarily on twentieth-century fiction in relation to music and sound. These interests drew me to Praxis in the first place: writing about sound is incredibly difficult in a print medium where the reader can’t hear what I describe. I am very excited to be a part of the Praxis team this year, where as a DH novitiate I hope to learn how technology can help make those two fields work together more easily. The Scholars’ Lab team seems happy to have us as well, welcoming the new team with open arms and inscrutable computer science jokes. Last year’s Praxis team reached out to us many months ago from their charter:

Preparations for future cohorts 
In order to allow the next Praxis Program team to start work right away on a project, we will make suggestions for that project before our tenure is over.

How nice to be thought of! But I think this excerpt shows how our situation is fundamentally different from theirs: last year’s team had to deal only with the future, but our team also has to deal with the past. It would be easy for us to feel anxiety as latecomers to the Praxis party, so I think it’s important that our own charter reflect the ways in which our work will talk back to last year’s team.
As I look through last year’s blog posts, I’m struck by the problem of knowledge we have in store for us. Implicit in the suggestions offered to us are all the ideas that last year’s team discarded, thought better of, and revised. Those are what I really want to see! The archive of blog posts can only give a skeletal sense of the past: there is no replacement for sitting in that chair all last year.
So beyond the question of how we deal with their great suggestions, I am struck by a more basic dilemma: what sort of dialogue will we have with last year’s group? I imagine that the cheerful team in the Scholars Lab will welcome repeat conversations as opportunities to rethink and retool, but I also believe that we can benefit from the experience of those who came before. I hope that we can continue the conversation with both those members of last year’s team that are still on grounds and those that have moved on to wonderful jobs across the country.
Even so, it is also important for us to recognize that, try as we might, we can never know everything about the project’s history to date. Our team will work better in the long run if we welcome the unknown and greet it just as enthusiastically as it welcomes us.
